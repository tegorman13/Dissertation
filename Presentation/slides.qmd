# Introduction 

-   Investigate effects of training variability on learning and generalization
-   Focus areas: visuomotor skill learning and function learning tasks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background and Motivation 

-   Importance of training variability
-   Research gaps in visuomotor skill learning
-   Previous research in category learning, language learning, and function learning

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Common Empirical Patterns

:::::::::  columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
### Training
- Both training conditions complete the same number of training trials.
- Varied group has worse training performance.

![](assets/train_pattern.png)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"} 
::: {.fragment}
### Testing

- Tested from novel conditions.
- Varied group has better test performance

![](assets/test_pattern.png)

::::::::: 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## But also plenty of contradictory results and complications

- Cases where varied training makes no difference
- Cases where more training variation results in worse outcomes
- Cases where the influence of variation interacts with some other factor
    - difficulty
    - prior knowledge
    - Frequency effects, or amount of training/learning before testing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Theoretical Frameworks

-   Schema Theory (Schmidt, 1975)
-   Desirable Difficulties Framework (Bjork & Bjork, 2011)
-   Challenge Point Framework (Guadagnoli & Lee, 2004)

- **Training Stage** - 200 training trials. Constant groups throws from single position. Varied group 60 trials from 2 locations. 
- **Transfer Stage** - All subjects tested from both positions they were trained, and the positions trained by other group
- **Data recorded** - For every throw, recorded the X velocity and Y velocity of ball at release

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project 1 Computational Model {.smaller .r-fit-text}

- For each subject, compute similarity between training throws and each of the 6 testing locations
- Test whether similarity explains the difference in performance between Constant and Varied conditions
  - Assuming equivalent generalization (1 c for both groups) - similarity improves model fit, but does not explain group difference
  - Assume training condition influences generalization gradient (fit c separately) - now similarity does explain the difference between Constant and Varied. 

::: footer
**Equation 1:** $$ Similarity_{I,J} = \sum_{i=I}\sum_{j=J} (e^{-c^\cdot d^{p}_{i,j}}) $$
**Equation 2:** $$ d_{i,j} = \sqrt{(x_{Train_i}-x_{Solution_j})^2 + (y_{Train_i}-y_{Solution_j})^2 } $$

# Project 2 - Variability and Extrapolation in a Function Learning Task

-   Influence of varied practice in a function learning task
-   Experiments 1, 2, and 3:
    -   Training regimes and testing conditions
    -   Learning, discrimination, and extrapolation performance metrics

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project 2 - Questions and Goals

**Empirical**
- Design a task-space large enough to assess multiple degrees of extrapolation 
- Compare varied and constant generalization from several distinct distances from their nearest training condition


**Model-based**
- If variation does influence extrapolation, can a connectionist model with similarity-based activation provide a good account?
- Can our modelling framework simultaneously account for both training and testing data?
- Accounting for the full distribution of responses

# General Discussion

-   Compare HTT and HTW
-   Empirical findings summary
-   Computational modeling contributions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Comparison {.smaller .r-fit-text}

| Dimension | HTT (Project 1) | HTW (Project 2) |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Task Description | Projectile launching to hit a target | Projectile launching to hit wall at a specific velocity |
| Task Complexity | More complex parabolic trajectory, both x and y velocities relevant to outcome | Simpler 1D mapping of force to outcome. Only x velocity is relevant. |
| Task Space | More complex: xy velocity combinations closer to the solution space may still result in worse feedback due to striking the barrier. | Simpler: smooth, linear mapping between velocity and feedback. |
| Perceptual salience of Varied Conditions | Varied conditions (# of throwing distances) are perceptually distinct, i.e. salient differences in distance between launching box and target. | Varied conditions (# of velocity bands) are less salient - only difference is the numeral displayed on screen. |
| Testing Feedback | Testing always included feedback | Primary testing stage had no feedback. |
| Potential for Learning during Testing | Limited potential for learning during testing due to feedback. | Some potential for learning during no-feedback testing by observing ball trajectory. |
| Training Experience | Varied group gets half as much experience on any one position as the constant group. | Varied group gets 1/3 as much experience on any one velocity band as the constant group. |
| Testing Structure | Random interleaving of trained/transfer testing distances. | Blocked structure, separately testing trained vs extrapolation testing bands. |
