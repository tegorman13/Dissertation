## Project 1 - Design  {.nostretch .smaller}

:::: {.columns}

### Experiment 1222
- Train varied group from 2 positions, and a constant group from 1.
- Test both groups from the trained positions - and 1 novel position

### Solution Space

### Full Space

Full Space of Solution Throws and Missed Throws. Colored points represent coordinates of target hits, brown points are coordinates of misses

::: {.column width="40%"}

### Model Steps 

- each of the 6 positions has an empirical solution space
- Compute the summed similarity between training throws, and solution spaces
  - separately for each participant, and each of the testing positions
- We now have a measure of how similar training behavior was to testing solutions

### Model Definition 

- $d_{i,j} = \sqrt{(x_{Train_i}-x_{Solution_j})^2 + (y_{Train_i}-y_{Solution_j})^2 }$
- $Similarity_{I,J} = \sum_{i=I}\sum_{j=J} (e^{-c^\cdot d^{p}_{i,j}})$

## Computational Model - Does Similarity Account for Effect of Variability?

- Test whether similarity explains the difference in performance between Constant and Varied conditions
  - Assuming equivalent generalization (1 c for both groups) - similarity improves model fit, but does not explain group difference
  - Assume training condition influences generalization gradient (fit c separately) - now similarity does explain the difference between Constant and Varied.

**Equation 1:** $$ Similarity_{I,J} = \sum_{i=I}\sum_{j=J} (e^{-c^\cdot d^{p}_{i,j}}) $$
**Equation 2:** $$ d_{i,j} = \sqrt{(x_{Train_i}-x_{Solution_j})^2 + (y_{Train_i}-y_{Solution_j})^2 } $$

## Issues with previous research {.smaller}

- Assumptions about what is encoded
- Assumptions about the formation of abstractions 
- Aggregation issues and similarity confounds

-  If generalization decays exponentially with distance, constant groups 1 and 2 may have far less generalization potential to the testing condition. 
- performance of individual constant groups often not reported in analyses.
