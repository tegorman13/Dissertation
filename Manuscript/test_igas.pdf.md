# Project 1


## Abstract

Exposing learners to variability during training has been demonstrated
to improve performance in subsequent transfer testing. Such variability
benefits are often accounted for by assuming that learners are
developing some general task schema or structure. However much of this
research has neglected to account for differences in similarity between
varied and constant training conditions. In a between-groups
manipulation, we trained participants on a simple projectile launching
task, with either varied or constant conditions. We replicate previous
findings showing a transfer advantage of varied over constant training.
Furthermore, we show that a standard similarity model is insufficient to
account for the benefits of variation, but, if the model is adjusted to
assume that varied learners are tuned towards a broader generalization
gradient, then a similarity-based model is sufficient to explain the
observed benefits of variation. Our results therefore suggest that some
variability benefits can be accommodated within instance-based models
without positing the learning of some schemata or structure.
