      \field{abstract}{To generate new movements, we have to generalize what we have learned from previously practiced movements. An important question, therefore, is how the breadth of training affects generalization: does practicing a broad or narrow range of movements lead to better generalization? We address this question with a force field learning experiment. One group adapted while making many reaches in a small region (narrow group), and another group adapted while making reaches in a large region (broad group). Subsequently, both groups were tested for their ability to generalize without visual feedback. Not surprisingly, the narrow group exhibited smaller adaptation errors, yet they did not generalize any better than the broad group. Path errors during generalization were indistinguishable across the two groups, whereas the broad group exhibited reduced terminal errors. These findings indicate that overall, practicing a variety of movements is advantageous for performance during generalization; movement paths are not hindered, and terminal errors are superior. Moreover, the evidence suggests a dissociation between the ability to generalize information about a novel dynamic disturbance, which generalizes narrowly, and the ability to locate the limb accurately in space, which generalizes broadly.}

      \field{abstract}{Building conceptual knowledge that generalizes to novel situations is a key function of human memory. Category-learning paradigms have long been used to understand the mechanisms of knowledge generalization. In the present study, we tested the conditions that promote formation of new concepts. Participants underwent one of six training conditions that differed in the number of examples per category (set size) and their relative similarity to the category average (set coherence). Performance metrics included rates of category learning, ability to generalize categories to new items of varying similarity to prototypes, and recognition memory for individual examples. In categorization, high set coherence led to faster learning and better generalization, while set size had little effect. Recognition did not differ reliably among conditions. We also tested the nature of memory representations used for categorization and recognition decisions using quantitative prototype and exemplar models fit to behavioral responses. Prototype models posit abstract category representations based on the category's central tendency, whereas exemplar models posit that categories are represented by individual category members. Prototype strategy use during categorization increased with increasing set coherence, suggesting that coherent training sets facilitate extraction of commonalities within a category. We conclude that learning from a coherent set of examples is an efficient means of forming abstract knowledge that generalizes broadly.}

      \field{abstract}{When we have learned a motor skill, such as cycling or ice- skating, we can rapidly generalize to novel tasks, such as motorcycling or rollerblading [1--8]. Such facilitation of learning could arise through two distinct mechanisms by which the motor system might adjust its control parameters. First, fast learning could simply be a consequence of the proximity of the original and final settings of the control parameters. Second, by structural learning [9--14], the motor system could constrain the parameter adjustments to conform to the control parameters' covariance structure. Thus, facilitation of learning would rely on the novel task parameters' lying on the structure of a lower-dimensional subspace that can be explored more efficiently. To test between these two hypotheses, we exposed subjects to randomly varying visuomotor tasks of fixed structure. Although such randomly varying tasks are thought to prevent learning, we show that when subsequently pre- sented with novel tasks, subjects exhibit three key features of structural learning: facilitated learning of tasks with the same structure, strong reduction in interference normally observed when switching between tasks that require oppo- site control strategies, and preferential exploration along the learned structure. These results suggest that skill gener- alization relies on task variation and structural learning.}

      \field{abstract}{Acquiring non-native speech contrasts can be difficult. A seminal study by Logan, Lively and Pisoni (1991) established the effectiveness of phonetic training for improving non-native speech perception: Japanese learners of English were trained to perceive /r/-/l/ using minimal pairs over 15 training sessions. A pre/post-test design established learning and generalisation. In a follow-up study, Lively, Logan and Pisoni (1993) presented further evidence which suggested that talker variability in training stimuli was crucial in leading to greater generalisation. These findings have been very influential and ``high variability phonetic training'' is now a standard methodology in the field. However, while the general benefit of phonetic training is well replicated, the evidence for an advantage of high over lower variability training remains mixed. In a large-scale replication of the original studies using updated statistical analyses we test whether learners generalise more after phonetic training using multiple talkers over a single talker. We find that listeners learn in both multiple and single talker conditions. However, in training, we find no difference in how well listeners learn for high vs low variability training. When comparing generalisation to novel talkers after training in relation to pre-training accuracy, we find ambiguous evidence for a high-variability benefit over low-variability training: This means that if a high-variability benefit exists, the effect is much smaller than originally thought, such that it cannot be detected in our sample of 166 listeners.}

      \field{abstract}{An especial skill occurs when performance of a single action from within a class of actions produces an advantage in performance. This advantage in a single action over others in the class is presumed to result from large amounts of practice performing the specific action (Keetch, Schmidt, Lee, \& Young, 2005). In an experiment involving the learning of a basketball set shot, practice was manipulated to identify whether an especial skill effect emerges at the free-throw line as a result of constant practice conditions in novice performers. After a pretest, which involved set shots across five distances, participants were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups. A constant practice group (n=10) performed 300 trials of the set shot at the 15ft free throw line only, whereas a variable practice group (n=10) performed 300 trials across five distances. Shot accuracy increased for both groups as a result of practice at the 15{$\prime$} distance. However, on the posttest, a significant difference was reported between actual and expected scores for the constant practice group only. This finding provided evidence that an effect similar to that seen for especial skills emerges as a result of constant practice. Although an especial skill effect could result from massive amounts of practice, we show it can emerge as a result of short term repetitive practice, indicating that the type, rather than amount, of practice is important.}

      \field{abstract}{This study investigated the ability to generalize acquired skills from training conditions to novel conditions, in a complex perceptual and cognitive task of luggage screening. We examined category and exemplar diversity during training for preparing learners to detect novel items during transfer. Category diversity was manipulated in terms of heterogeneity of training categories: Participants either trained with targets from one category or with targets from several categories. Exemplar diversity was manipulated between participants by presenting either a few or many exemplars for both category diversity conditions. Seventy-two participants were trained to identify threats in pieces of luggage. Thereafter they were transferred to novel stimuli. Results can be summarized in support for the diversity of training hypothesis for preparing for novelty: To the best training for novel luggage screening situations is achieved using fewer items in a variety of categories.

      \field{abstract}{Research in face recognition has tended to focus on discriminating between individuals, or ``telling people apart.'' It has recently become clear that it is also necessary to understand how images of the same person can vary, or ``telling people together.'' Learning a new face, and tracking its representation as it changes from unfamiliar to familiar, involves an abstraction of the variability in different images of that person's face. Here, we present an application of principal components analysis computed across different photos of the same person. We demonstrate that people vary in systematic ways, and that this variability is idiosyncratic---the dimensions of variability in one face do not generalize well to another. Learning a new face therefore entails learning how that face varies. We present evidence for this proposal and suggest that it provides an explanation for various effects in face recognition. We conclude by making a number of testable predictions derived from this framework.}

      \field{abstract}{An assumption of Schmidt's schema theory is that variable practice will enhance the development of schema which will in turn facilitate transfer to situations requiring novel responses. This assumption has been supported in research with both open and closed tasks as defined by Poulton. In an open task-study the novel response was within the range of responses previously experienced by subjects. The present study using an open task concerned whether acquisition of novel responses outside the range of the subjects' past experience would be facilitated by variability of practice. The results confirmed schema theory. Subjects with variable practice showed greater transfer to a novel speed outside the range of training than subjects trained under constant practice. A generalization gradient was obtained. Further the novel conditions were from training conditions, the poorer the transfer a p peared to be. However, generalization decrement was attenuated with variable practice.}

      \field{abstract}{Variability in practice has been shown to enhance motor skill learning. Benefits of practice variability have been attributed to motor schema formation (variable versus constant practice), or more effortful information processing (random versus blocked practice). We hypothesized that, among other mechanisms, greater practice variability might promote an external focus of attention on the intended movement effect, while less variability would be more conducive to a less effective internal focus on body movements. In Experiment 1, the learning of a throwing task was enhanced by variable versus constant practice, and variable group participants reported focusing more on the distance to the target (external focus), while constant group participants focused more on their posture (internal focus). In Experiment 2, golf putting was learned more effectively with a random compared with a blocked practice schedule. Furthermore, random group learners reported using a more effective distal external focus (i.e., distance to the target) to a greater extent, whereas blocked group participants used a less effective proximal focus (i.e., putter) more often. While attentional focus was assessed through questionnaires in the first two experiments, learners in Experiment 3 were asked to report their current attentional focus at any time during practice. Again, the learning of a throwing task was more effective after random relative to blocked practice. Also, random practice learners reported using more external focus cues, while in blocked practice participants used more internal focus cues. The findings suggest that the attentional foci induced by different practice schedules might be at least partially responsible for the learning differences.}

      \field{abstract}{Experiments were conducted in which observers learned to classify simple perceptual stimuli into low-variability and high-variability categories. Similarities between objects were measured in independent psychological-scaling tasks. The results showed that observers classified transfer stimuli into the high-variability categories with greater probability than was predicted by a baseline version of an exemplar-similarity model. Qualitative evidence for the role of category variability on perceptual classification, which could not be explained in terms of the baseline exemplar-similarity model, was obtained as well. Possible accounts of the effects of category variability are considered in the General Discussion section.}

      \field{abstract}{Decision-making is a complex action requiring efficient information processing. Specifically, in movement in which performance efficiency depends on reaction time, e.g., open-loop controlled movements, these processes may play a crucial role. Information processing includes three distinct stages, stimulus identification, response selection, and response programming. Mainly, response selection may play a substantial contribution to the reaction time and appropriate decision making. The duration of this stage depends on the number of possible choices an individual has to ``screen'' to make a proper decision. Given that reaction time is crucial in many sports, the possibilities of reducing it through practice are very tempting. The information processing and its relationship to the manner an individual is practicing are discussed. Especially the variability of practice issues will be explored. In variable practice conditions, an individual has to react to one or more stimuli and has to produce one of the many variations of the same movement or different movements they learned. One has to identify a stimulus appropriately and has to select a response optimally, i.e., choosing from as few choices as possible to reduce the reaction time. On the other hand, in constant practice conditions, an individual can be exposed to one or many stimuli. Still, there is only one variation of the movement that can be executed in the presence of a learned stimulus. Based on the information processing theory and the results of the research focusing on variability of practice, I discuss how the practice conditions may affect reaction time and, as a result, the decision-making process. I conceptually frame the possible implications of practice conditions on decision making related to information processing. In this review, a possible mechanism and relationship between practice conditions and decision-making are presented. Future research directions are presented.}

      \field{abstract}{The ocquisition and transfer effects of contextual interference (Battig, 1979) wereinvestigated on a coincidence anticipation task. The experimental task required subjects to make predictive judgementssothat theirresponses coincided withthearrival ofa light stimulus. Sixtyfemales wereselected from an octivity questionnaire determiningthe extent of experience in similar tasks. One half were selected reporting no experience, and the remaining subjects had prior and present involvement in tasks requiring predictive judgements. Battig's (1979) conceptualization of memory was supportedfor experienced subjects in one transfer task. Experienced subjects who processed the acquisition tasks in high contextual interference (random orderofpresentation) performed signifICantly better than novice subjects in the sameacquisuio>> context. In addition,acquisition under a randomsequencefaciluated transfer to a novel taskfor experienced subjects as compared to acquisiuon under a constant order of presentation. Furthermore, evidence was found to support individual differences in processing. These data strongly supportthat subjects' real worldexperience with motorskills is an important consideration in laboratory research. FinaUy, inclusion of other, more descriptive independent variables is recommended when employingfemales so that differences attributed to gender can be moreproperly attributed to prior experience.}

During training, participants associated stimulus and response magnitudes (in the form of horizontal bar lengths) that covaried according to a linear, exponential, or quadratic function. After training, novel stimulus magnitudes were presented as tests of extrapolation and interpolation. Participants extrapolated well beyond the range of learned responses, and their responses captured the general shape of the assigned functions, with some systematic deviations. Notable individual differences were observed, particularly in the quadratic condition. The number of unique stimulus--response pairs given during training (i.e., density) was also manipulated but did not affect training or transfer performance. Two rule-learning models, an associative-learning model, and a new hybrid model with associative learning and rule-based responding (extrapolation--association model [EXAM]) were evaluated with respect to the transfer data. EXAM best approximated the overall pattern of extrapolation performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

      \field{abstract}{The purpose of this study was to see how people perceive their own learning during a category learning task, and whether their perceptions matched their performance. In two experiments, participants were asked to learn natural categories, of both high and low variability, and make category learning judgements (CLJs). Variability was manipulated by varying the number of exemplars and the number of times each exemplar was presented within each category. Experiment 1 showed that participants were generally overconfident in their knowledge of low variability families, suggesting that they considered repetition to be more useful for learning than it actually was. Also, a correct trial, for a particular category, was more likely to occur if the previous trial was correct. CLJs had the largest increase when a trial was correct following an incorrect trial and the largest decrease when an incorrect trial followed a correct trial. Experiment 2 replicated these results, but also demonstrated that global CLJ ratings showed the same bias towards repetition. These results indicate that we generally identify success as being the biggest determinant of learning, but do not always recognise cues, such as variability, that enhance learning.}

      \field{abstract}{Fear generalization refers to conditioned fear responses extending to related stimuli and fear overgeneralization is a key feature of pathological anxiety. Along with perception similarity, conceptual relations affect fear generalization. We investigated whether stimulus diversity--an important principle of category-based induc\- tion--influences fear generalization. Induction studies have shown that generalization from a premise involving diverse instances is stronger than that from non-diverse instances. We adopted this framework for fear learning and established two groups. The diverse group developed fear in response to diverse instances from one category, while the non-diverse group acquired fear of non-diverse instances from the same category. An effect of stimulus diversity was observed in shock-expectancy ratings, with the diverse group displaying higher fear generalization than the non-diverse group. We also tested whether intolerance of uncertainty (IU) might affect the difference in fear generalization between the two conditions. Individuals with higher IU showed reduced difference in fear generalization between two conditions, mainly driven by heightened fear generalization to novel stimulus with ambiguous threat levels in the non-diverse condition. This study helps illustrate the mechanisms behind dif\- ferential category-based fear generalization and provides a potential explanation for why higher IU individuals may develop anxiety disorders following trauma.}

      \field{abstract}{The goal of training is to produce learning for a range of activities that are typically more general than the training task itself. Despite a century of research, predicting the scope of learning from the content of training has proven extremely difficult, with the same task producing narrowly focused learning strategies in some cases and broadly scoped learning strategies in others. Here we test the hypothesis that human subjects will prefer a decision strategy that maximizes performance and reduces uncertainty given the demands of the training task and that the strategy chosen will then predict the extent to which learning is transferable. To test this hypothesis, we trained subjects on a moving dot extrapolation task that makes distinct predictions for two types of learning strategy: a narrow model-free strategy that learns an input-output mapping for training stimuli, and a general model-based strategy that utilizes humans' default predictive model for a class of trajectories. When the number of distinct training trajectories is low, we predict better performance for the mapping strategy, but as the number increases, a predictive model is increasingly favored. Consonant with predictions, subject extrapolations for test trajectories were consistent with using a mapping strategy when trained on a small number of training trajectories and a predictive model when trained on a larger number. The general framework developed here can thus be useful both in interpreting previous patterns of task-specific versus task-general learning, as well as in building future training paradigms with certain desired outcomes.}

      \field{abstract}{Classical theories of attention posit that integration of features into object representation (or feature binding) requires engagement of focused attention. Studies challenging this idea have demonstrated that feature binding can happen outside of the focus of attention for familiar objects, as well as for arbitrary color-orientation conjunctions. Detection performance for arbitrary feature conjunction improves with training, suggesting a potential role of perceptual learning mechanisms in the integration of features, a process called ``binding-learning''. In the present study, we investigate whether stimulus variability and task relevance, two critical determinants of visual perceptual learning, also modulate binding-learning. Transfer of learning in a visual search task to a pre-exposed color-orientation conjunction was assessed under conditions of varying stimulus variability and task relevance. We found transfer of learning for the pre-exposed feature conjunctions that were trained with high variability (Experiment 1). Transfer of learning was not observed when the conjunction was rendered taskirrelevant during training due to pop-out targets (Experiment 2). Our findings show that feature binding is determined by principles of perceptual learning, and they support the idea that functions traditionally attributed to goal-driven attention can be grounded in the learning of the statistical structure of the environment.}

      \field{abstract}{Why, when, and how do stereotypes change? This paper develops a computational account based on the principles of structure learning: stereotypes are governed by probabilistic beliefs about the assignment of individuals to groups. Two aspects of this account are particularly important. First, groups are flexibly constructed based on the distribution of traits across individuals; groups are not fixed, nor are they assumed to map on to categories we have to provide to the model. This allows the model to explain the phenomena of group discovery and subtyping, whereby deviant individuals are segregated from a group, thus protecting the group's stereotype. Second, groups are hierarchically structured, such that groups can be nested. This allows the model to explain the phenomenon of subgrouping, whereby a collection of deviant individuals is organized into a refinement of the superordinate group. The structure learning account also sheds light on several factors that determine stereotype change, including perceived group variability, individual typicality, cognitive load, and sample size.}

      \field{abstract}{This study used a forehand hitting task to explore the effect of racket variability on 'out of range' transfer. 48 11-yr.-old girls were randomly assigned to four treatment groups of Random Variability, Blocked Variabhty, Specific, and Control. The experimental groups had 32 trials for 4 successive days after which all groups were tested on 4 transfer conditions. Retention tests were given after 1, 4, and 8 days and the data were examined for treatment, range, and occasion effects. Analysis showed the superiority of practice over no practice, variable over specific practice, and random over blocked variability for transfer with two 'out of range' dimensions. Accuracy decayed between the transfer tests. These results are consistent with schema theory, and it is recommended that physical education teachers should focus variable practice on task dimensions that are new to their classes.}

      \field{abstract}{In climbing, the visual system is confronted with a dual demand: controlling ongoing movement and searching for upcoming movement possibilities. The aims of the present research were: (i) to investigate the effect of different modes of practice on how learners deal with this dual demand; and (ii) to analyze the extent this effect may facilitate transfer of learning to a new climbing route. The effect of a constant practice, an imposed schedule of variations and a self-controlled schedule of variations on the gaze behaviors and the climbing fluency of novices were compared. Results showed that the constant practice group outperformed the imposed variability group on the training route and the three groups climbing fluency on the transfer route did not differ. Analyses of the gaze behaviors showed that the constant practice group used more online gaze control during the last session whereas the imposed variability group relied on a more proactive gaze control. This last gaze pattern was also used on the transfer route by the imposed variability group. Self-controlled variability group displayed more interindividual differences in gaze behaviors. These findings reflect that learning protocols induce different timing for gaze patterns that may differently facilitate adaptation to new climbing routes.}

      \field{abstract}{Studied the abstraction of prototypical information and the development of category breadth or categories defined by low-level distortions from the prototype or by a mixing of distortion levels, using 72 undergraduates. In the uniform-low condition, low-level distortions were classified into 3 categories containing 3, 6, and 9 stimuli; in the mixed condition, an equal number of stimuli at each of 3 distortion levels was classified into categories of sizes 3, 6, and 9. Subsequent transfer to old, new and prototype stimuli was investigated immediately and after delays of 1 and 10 wks. The degree of positive transfer to new instances interacted with category size such that a mixing of distortions resulted in superior transfer for the categories defined by a larger number of stimuli; transfer was greater for the uniform-low condition only when the category was defined by 3 instances. The influence of category size was maintaind across the 10-wk delay for the mixed condition, and, overall, the mixed categories tended to resist deterioration following long delays better than categories defined by low-level distortions.

      \field{abstract}{Face recognition is a challenging classification task that humans perform effortlessly for familiar faces. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of exposure to high variability appearances of the same identity to perform this task. However, these studies did not explicitly measure the perceptual similarity between the learned images and the images presented at test, which may account for the advantage of learning from high variability. Particularly, randomly selected test images are more likely to be perceptually similar to learned high variability images, and dissimilar to learned low variability images. Here we dissociated effects of learning from variability and study-test perceptual similarity, by collecting human similarity ratings for the study and test images. Using these measures, we independently manipulated the variability between the learning images and their perceptual similarity to the test images. Different groups of participants learned face identities from a low or high variability set of images. The learning phase was followed by a face matching test (Experiment 1) or a face recognition task (Experiment 2) that presented novel images of the learned identities that were perceptually dissimilar or similar to the learned images. Results of both experiments show that perceptual similarity between study and test, rather than image variability at learning per se, predicts face recognition. We conclude that learning from high variability improves face recognition for perceptually similar but not for perceptually dissimilar images. These findings may not be specific to faces and should be similarly evaluated for other domains.}

      \field{abstract}{Category variability or diversity is an important factor influencing generalization. However, expectations of category variability may not only depend on the variability of encountered category members but may also be shaped by prior experiences with similar categories. In this study, we investigated whether we could influence category generalization by inducing different category representations in an "A, Non-A" categorization task: Participants either learned about a homogeneous category Non-A or a diverse category Non-A during a priming phase. In order to better understand the transfer process, we varied the nature of the learning phase from implicit transfer to explicit instructions that actively requested that participants use their prior experiences. We found that while with a homogeneous Non-A representation, generalization of the A and Non-A categories was equal, the generalization of category Non-A widened after a priming phase with a diverse representation. In a second experiment, we found that the widening of generalization of category Non-A occurred when the exemplars in this category were themselves diverse (feature-diverse condition) but not when the category contained distinct exemplars (exemplar-diverse condition). These results suggests that categorization is influenced by previous categorization experiences possibly altering the representation of a category. Further, the study gives a hint what kind of heterogeneity is needed to observe the commonly reported broader generalization of diverse categories. The finding has implications not only to understand the influence of prior experiences on category learning, but any cognitive process that hinges on generalization.}

      \field{abstract}{Models of category learning can take two different approaches to representing the relationship between objects and categories. The generative approach solves the categorization problem by building a probabilistic model of each category and using Bayes' rule to infer category labels. In contrast, the discriminative approach directly learns a mapping between inputs and category labels. With this distinction in mind, we revisit a previously studied categorization experiment that showed people are biased towards categorizing objects into a category with higher variability. Modelling results predict that generative learners should be more greatly affected by category variability than discriminative learners. We show that humans can be prompted to adopt either a generative or discriminative approach to learning the same input, resulting in the predicted effect on use of category variability.}

      \field{abstract}{Classic studies of human categorization learning provided evidence that high-variability training in the prototype-distortion paradigm enhances subsequent generalization to novel test patterns from the learned categories. More recent work suggests, however, that when the number of training trials is equated across low-variability and high-variability training conditions, it is low-variability training that yields better generalization performance. Whereas the recent studies used cartoon-animal stimuli varying along binary-valued dimensions, in the present work we return to the use of prototype-distorted dot-pattern stimuli that had been used in the original classic studies. In accord with the recent findings, we observe that high-variability training does not enhance generalization in the dot-pattern prototype-distortion paradigm when the total number of training trials is equated across the conditions, even when training with very large numbers of distinct instances. A baseline version of an exemplar model captures the major qualitative pattern of results in the experiment, as do prototype models that make allowance for changes in parameter settings across the different training conditions. Based on the modeling results, we hypothesize that although high-variability training does not enhance generalization in the prototype-distortion paradigm, it may do so when participants learn more complex category structures.}

      \field{abstract}{The present study reports two experiments in which a total of 20 participants without prior flight experience practiced the final approach phase in a fixed-base simulator. All participants received self-controlled concurrent feedback during 180 practice trials. Experiment 1 shows that participants learn more quickly under variable practice conditions than under constant practice conditions. This finding is attributed to the education of attention to the more useful informational variables: Variability of practice reduces the usefulness of initially used informational variables, which leads to a quicker change in variable use, and hence to a larger improvement in performance. In the practice phase of Experiment 2 variability was selectively applied to some experimental factors but not to others. Participants tended to converge toward the variables that were useful in the specific conditions that they encountered during practice. This indicates that an explanation for variability of practice effects in terms of the education of attention is a useful alternative to traditional explanations based on the notion of the generalized motor program and to explanations based on the notions of noise and local minima.

      \field{abstract}{High phonological neighborhood density has been associated with both advantages and disadvantages in early word learning. High density may support the formation and fine-tuning of new word sound memories---a process termed lexical configuration (e.g., Storkel, 2004). However, new high-density words are also more likely to be misunderstood as instances of known words, and may therefore fail to trigger the learning process (e.g., Swingley \& Aslin, 2007). To examine these apparently contradictory effects, we trained an autoencoder neural network on 587,954 word tokens (5,497 types, including mono- and multisyllabic words of all grammatical classes) spoken by 279 caregivers to English-speaking children aged 18--24 months. We then simulated a communicative development inventory administration and compared network performance to that of 2,292 children aged 18--24 months. We argue that autoencoder performance illustrates concurrent density advantages and disadvantages, in contrast to prior behavioral and computational literature treating such effects independently. Low network error rates signal a configuration advantage for high-density words, while high network error rates signal a triggering advantage for low-density words. This interpretation is consistent with the application of autoencoders in academic research and industry, for simultaneous feature extraction (i.e., configuration) and anomaly detection (i.e., triggering). Autoencoder simulation therefore illustrates how apparently contradictory density and distinctiveness effects can emerge from a common learning mechanism.

      \field{abstract}{Though practice can lead to improved performance in many domains, it is currently unknown how practice affects the deployment of selective attention to filter distracting information. We conducted a series of experiments to address this issue by examining how performance on a task changed after repeated exposure to distractors. Distraction initially slowed response time during task performance, an effect that diminished with repeated exposure to the distractors. When the distractors were consistent in appearance, the practice effect developed quickly but was stimulus-specific. When the distractors were more variable in appearance, the practice effect developed slowly but transferred more readily to other conditions. These data indicate that practice with overcoming distraction leads to improvements in information filtering mechanisms that generalize beyond the training regimen when variable distractor stimuli are experienced.}

      \field{abstract}{To assess the potential effect of specific and varied practice on the development of motor schema, 64 children in two age groups (8 yr. and 12 yr.) were tested on a simple throwing task at the beginning and end of a 12-wk. physical education program. For the throwing test the children were assigned to either a specificity or a schema group (varied practice). The task was performed without visual feedback, but knowledge of results was given after each trial. Prior to both tests at the criterion target, the specific group was given practice throws using the criterion target distance, whereas the schema group practiced on two other targets. No differences were found between the two groups at the beginning of the program but on the posttest those children receiving a variety of practice on the throwing task performed significantly better than the specific-practice group. Thus it was suggested that a varied practice schedule may facilitate the initial formation of motor schema, and this process may be enhanced by participation in a physical education program.}

      \field{abstract}{People often perceive their in-groups as more heterogeneous than their out-groups. We propose an information sampling explanation for this in-group heterogeneity effect. We note that people frequently obtain larger samples of information about in-groups than about out-groups. Using computer simulations, we show that this asymmetry in sample sizes implies the in-group heterogeneity effect under a wide range of assumptions about how experience affects perceived variability. This is the case even when perceived variability is the outcome of rational information processing, implying that the structure of the environment is sufficient to explain the emergence of the in-group heterogeneity effect. A key assumption of our explanation is that perceived group variability depends on the size of the sample observed about this group. We provide evidence in support for this assumption in two experiments. Our results considerably expand the scope and relevance of a prior sampling explanation proposed by Linville, Fischer, and Salovey (1989). They also complement other explanations that proposed that information about in-groups and out-groups is processed differently. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)}

      \field{abstract}{High variability training has been shown to benefit the learning of new face identities. In three experiments, we investigated whether this is also the case for voice identity learning. In Experiment 1a, we contrasted high variability training sets -- which included stimuli extracted from a number of different recording sessions, speaking environments and speaking styles -- with low variability stimulus sets that only included a single speaking style (read speech) extracted from one recording session (see Ritchie \& Burton, 2017 for faces). Listeners were tested on an old/new recognition task using read sentences (i.e. test materials fully overlapped with the low variability training stimuli) and we found a high variability disadvantage. In Experiment 1b, listeners were trained in a similar way, however, now there was no overlap in speaking style or recording session between training sets and test stimuli. Here, we found a high variability advantage. In Experiment 2, variability was manipulated in terms of the number of unique items as opposed to number of unique speaking styles. Here, we contrasted the high variability training sets used in Experiment 1a with low variability training sets that included the same breadth of styles, but fewer unique items; instead, individual items were repeated (see Murphy, Ipser, Gaigg, \& Cook, 2015 for faces). We found only weak evidence for a high variability advantage, which could be explained by stimulus-specific effects. We propose that high variability advantages may be particularly pronounced when listeners are required to generalise from trained stimuli to different-sounding, previously unheard stimuli. We discuss these findings in the context of mechanisms thought to underpin advantages for high variability training.}

      \field{abstract}{In property induction tasks, encountering a diverse range of instances (e.g., hippos and hamsters) with a given property usually increases our willingness to generalise that property to a novel instance, relative to non-diverse evidence (e.g., hippos and rhinos). Although generalisation in property induction and predictive learning tasks share conceptual similarities, it is unknown whether this diversity principle applies to generalisation of a predictive association. We tested this hypothesis in two predictive learning experiments using differential training where one category of stimuli (e.g., fruits) predicted an outcome and another category (e.g., vegetables) predicted no outcome. We compared generalisation between a Non-Diverse group who were presented with non-diverse evidence in both positive (predicted the outcome) and negative (predicted no outcome) categories, and two groups who received the same training as the Non-Diverse group but with a more diverse range of exemplars in the positive (Diverse+ group) or negative (Diverse-- group) category. Diversity effects were found for both positive and negative categories, in that learning about a diverse range of exemplars increased generalisation of a predictive association to novel exemplars from that same category. The results suggest that diversity, a key principle describing how we reason inductively, also applies to generalisation in associative learning tasks.}

      \field{abstract}{Two studies are reported that support the hypothesis that categories that require a multiple-unit, as opposed to a single-unit, representation lead to worse initial acquisition but better generalization. On the basis of the constraints imposed by the procedural-based learning system thought to mediate information-integration categorization, we argue that the need to train multiple units during initial category acquisition slows the procedural-based category learning process and adversely affects learning performance. However, we speculate that better generalization occurs because of the increased likelihood that a novel stimulus will activate at least one of the multiple units needed to represent the category. Relations to other findings in the literature and the implications of this work for training and clinical assessment are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{People are poor at matching the identity of unfamiliar faces, but very good at identifying familiar faces. Theoretical accounts suggest that representations derived from exposure to variation are instrumental in driving this familiarity based improvement. In support of this, recent work shows that providing multiple photographs of an unfamiliar face improves identity verification accuracy. Here, we test whether the extent of variation is critical to this improvement, by manipulating the degree of within-identity variation that participants are exposed to in a sequential matching test. Participants were more accurate and adopted more liberal response criteria, when matching high-variability pairs to probe images, compared with either low-variability pairs or single images. Importantly, benefits of variation are not explained by independent contributions of single images, suggesting that people extrapolate information across images to produce gains in identification accuracy. These results suggest that photo-ID can be improved by incorporating broader ranges of variation in facial appearance.}

      \field{abstract}{One aspect of human vision unmatched by machines is the capacity to generalize from few samples. Observers tend to know when novel objects are in the same class despite large differences in shape, material or viewpoint. A major challenge in studying such generalization is that participants can see each novel sample only once. To overcome this, we used crowdsourcing to obtain responses from 500 human observers on 20 novel object classes, with each stimulus compared to 1 or 16 related objects. The results reveal that humans generalize from sparse data in highly systematic ways with the number and variance of the samples. We compared human responses to `ShapeComp', an image-computable model based on {$>$}100 shape descriptors, and `AlexNet', a convolution neural network that roughly matches humans at recognizing 1000 categories of real-world objects. With 16 samples, the models were consistent with human responses without free parameters. Thus, when there are a sufficient number of samples, observers rely on shallow but efficient processes based on a fixed set of features. With 1 sample, however, the models required different feature weights for each object. This suggests that one-shot categorization involves more sophisticated processes that actively identify the unique characteristics underlying each object class.}

      \field{abstract}{The present study examined the effect of stimulus variability and practice order on generalization to novel stimuli following a single session of response inhibition training. Ninety-six young adults practiced the Go/No-go task online in three training conditions: (1) constant (N\,=\,32)---inhibition practiced on one stimulus; (2) variable-blocked (N\,=\,32)---inhibition practiced on 6 stimuli, each in a separate block; and (3) variable-random (N\,=\,32)---inhibition practiced on 6 stimuli in random order. Generalization was measured by comparing groups on inhibition of novel stimuli and a trained stimulus immediately and 24~h after training. Consistent with our hypothesis, the variable-random and the variable-blocked groups showed better generalization to the novel items than the constant group, demonstrating the benefit of stimulus variability. The variable-random group also showed better generalization than the variable-blocked group, demonstrating the benefit of presenting stimuli in random order. Participants' capacity for working memory maintenance was found to modulate the effect of practice order. While the benefit of variability was retained 24~h after training, the effect of order was not. Results also show generalization to (1) different type of stimuli using the same task and (2) the same stimuli on a different response inhibition task (the Stop-Signal Task), however, the effect of variable practice and order were not evident in these cases. The study findings illustrate the advantage of using variable stimuli presented in random order for generalization and suggest that these principles of motor learning can be applied to learning of cognitive skills.}

      \field{abstract}{In table tennis the follow-through action after a shot is an important part of skill execution. In this experiment, we aimed to extend literature around the contextual interference effect by investigating whether the way the follow-through is organised in practice affects learning of the backhand shot in table tennis. Thirty unskilled participants were allocated to blocked-variable practice, random-variable practice or a control-constant group and aimed backhand shots towards a target following ball projection from a machine. Each group completed these shots in a pre-test, a training phase with follow-through manipulations, a post-test, and a retention test. The random-variable group improved their shot accuracy from pre-test to post-test and from pre-test to retention test (both P {$<$} 0.01, d = 1.03), whereas neither the blocked-variable nor the control-constant group displayed any change in shot accuracy. Practising the follow-through in a random-variable fashion enhanced learning of the preceding shot compared with blocked-variable practice or no follow-through instructions. The benefits of learning motor skills under conditions of high contextual interference also apply to how follow-through actions are organised. The findings are valuable to coaches and suggest that instructions related to the follow-through action should be considered as well as the primary skill itself.}

      \field{abstract}{A unified quantitative approach to modeling Ss' identification and categorization of multidimensional perceptual stimuli is proposed and tested. Two Ss identified and categorized the same set of perceptually confusable stimuli varying on separable dimensions. The identification data were modeled using R. N. Shepard's (see record 1959-05134-001) multidimensional scaling-choice framework, which was then extended to model the Ss' categorization performance. The categorization model, which generalizes the context theory of classification developed by D. L. Medin and M. M. Schaffer (see record 1979-12633-001), assumes that Ss store category exemplars in memory. Classification decisions are based on the similarity of stimuli to the stored exemplars. It is assumed that the same multidimensional perceptual representation underlies performance in both the identification and categorization paradigms. However, because of the influence of selective attention, similarity relationships change systematically across the 2 paradigms. Findings provide some support for the hypothesis that Ss distribute attention among component dimensions so as to optimize categorization performance and that Ss may have augmented their category representations with inferred exemplars. Results demonstrate that excellent predictions of categorization performance can be made given knowledge of performance in an identification paradigm.}

      \field{abstract}{Under the guidance of a formal exemplar model of categorization, we conduct comparisons of natural-science classification learning across four conditions in which the nature of the training examples is manipulated. The specific domain of inquiry is rock classification in the geologic sciences; the goal is to use the model to search for optimal training examples for teaching the rock categories. On the positive side, the model makes a number of successful predictions: Most notably, compared with conditions involving focused training on small sets of training examples, generalization to novel transfer items is significantly enhanced in a condition in which learners experience a broad swath of training examples from each category. Nevertheless, systematic departures from the model predictions are also observed. Further analyses lead us to the hypothesis that the high-dimensional featurespace representation derived for the rock stimuli (to which the exemplar model makes reference) systematically underestimates within-category similarities. We suggest that this limitation is likely to arise in numerous situations in which investigators attempt to build detailed feature-space representations for naturalistic categories. A low-parameter extended version of the model that adjusts for this limitation provides dramatically improved accounts of performance across the four conditions. We outline future steps for enhancing the current feature-space representation and continuing our goal of using formal psychological models to guide the search for effective methods of teaching science categories.}

      \field{abstract}{Constant and variable practice conditions have been hypothesized to lead to different learning outcomes between them but similar within. However, experiments have found that within a constant practice condition, participants can show highly individual outcomes (i.e., coordination functions). Considering the contradictory evidence on the effects of variable practice, we tested the idea that measures of the individual learned outcome would be required to provide a full explanation for results in transfer tests rather than or in addition to the group task-related conditions on which individuals practiced. Twenty-four participants were divided into three groups with different practice conditions (constant, varied distance of the target, and varied angle of the target) and for 5 days performed a task of throwing for precision to a target. Pre-, post-, and transfer tests were used to evaluate our hypothesis. The results showed that although the group measures could predict certain aspects of the transfer tests, the coordination function characteristics were required to show higher levels of explanatory power. This finding supports the view that learning involves a specific, individual and generalizable solution although there are aspects of learning that are specific to the condition of practice.}

      \field{abstract}{We conducted two experiments to investigate the acquisition and representation of social categories, with an emphasis on the perception of variability of group members. In Experiment 1, subjects learned about a group that was sociable and intelligent and either high or low in variability with respect to these attributes. Differences in the actual variability of group members were reflected in subjects' estimates of variability, in their tendency to generalize from the traits and goals of a single member to the entire group, and in their classification judgments of new instances, which reflected their expectations of group members' future behavior. Memory for instances of the category also played a role in these judgment tasks. In Experiment 2, subjects who first learned about the behaviors performed by group members and then about general characteristics of the group perceived the group as more variable than did those who learned the same information in the reverse order. In both experiments, we manipulated memory for specific behaviors such that either the most extreme behaviors or behaviors at the center of the distribution were most memorable. This manipulation did not afiect estimates of perceived variability, suggesting that these were constructed and stored on-line rather than from a retrieved set of category exemplars.}

      \field{abstract}{The issue of how category variability affects classification of novel instances is an important one for assessing theories of categorization, yet previous research cannot provide a compelling conclusion. In five experiments we re-examine some of the factors which are thought to affect participant performance. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants almost always classified the test item as belonging to the high-variability category. By contrast, in Experiment 3 we employed an alternative experimental paradigm, where the difference in variability of the two categories was less salient. In that case, participants tended to classify a test item as belonging to the low-variability category. Two additional experiments (4 and 5) explored in detail the differences between Experiments 1, 2 on the one hand, and 3 on the other. Some insight into the underlying psychological processes can be provided by computational models of categorization, and we focus on the continuous version of Anderson's (1991) Rational Model, which has not been explored before in this context. The model predicts that test instances exactly halfway between the prototypes of two categories should be classified into the more variable category, consistent with the bulk of empirical findings. We also provided a comparison with a slightly reduced version of the Generalized Context Model (GCM) to show that its predictions are consistent with those from the Rational Model, for our stimulus sets.}

      \field{abstract}{Research suggests variability supports successful categorization, however, the scope of variability's support at the level of higher-order generalization remains unexplored. A longitudinal study examined the role of exemplar variability in first- and second-order generalization in the context of early nominal-category learning. Sixteen eighteen-month-old children were taught twelve categories. Half were taught with sets of highly similar exemplars; half with sets of more variable exemplars. Participants' learning and generalization of trained labels and their development of more general word-learning biases were tested. All children learned labels for trained exemplars, but children trained with variable exemplars generalized to novel exemplars of these categories, developed a discriminating word-learning bias generalizing labels of novel solid objects by shape and nonsolids by material, and accelerated in vocabulary acquisition. These data demonstrate that variability leads to better abstraction of individual and global category organization, increasing learning outside the laboratory.}

      \field{abstract}{The generality of the variability in practice prediction, arising from Schmidt's schema theory (1975) of motor learning was tested on young children. More specifically, the structure of the variability session and its subsequent influence on transfer performance to a novel variation of the task was examined. Children tossed a weighted bean bag to a fixed target location. Three groups experienced variability in practice with four bean bags of varying weights (3,4,5, and 6 oz.); however, the trial-by-trial presentation of each weight was different for each group. One group received a random presentation of each weight from trial to trial while another experienced random presentations of a weight for blocks of three trials. The third variability group received blocked practice with six trials per blockfor each weight. All variability groups experienced the same amount of practice at each weight. A constant practice group experienced only a single weight. Following 24 practice trials, all subjects transferred outside the range of previous experience, receiving three trials with one of two possible test weights (2 oz. or 7 oz.). The results indicated that the variability group practicing with blocks of three trials at each variation led to superior performance at transfer to novel variations of the task. Overall, the experiment suggested that transfer performance for children is affected by the appropriate structure of variable practice which formulates the schemata for movement production.}

      \field{abstract}{Abstract Objects are grouped into categories through a complex combination of statistical and structural regularities. We sought to better understand the neural responses to the structural features of object categories that result from implicit learning. Adult participants were exposed to 32 object categories that contained three structural properties: frequency, variability, and co-occurrences, during an implicit learning task. After this exposure, participants completed a recognition task and were then presented with blocks of learned object categories during fMRI sessions. Analyses were performed by extracting data from ROIs placed throughout the fusiform gyri and lateral occipital cortex and comparing the effects of the different structural properties throughout the ROIs. Behaviorally, we found that symbol category recognition was supported by frequency, but not variability. Neurally, we found that sensitivity to object categories was greater in the right hemisphere and increased as ROIs were moved posteriorly. Frequency and variability altered the brain activation while processing object categories, although the presence of learned co-occurrences did not. Moreover, variability and co-occurrence interacted as a function of ROI, with the posterior fusiform gyrus being most sensitive to this relationship. This result suggests that variability may guide the learner to relevant co-occurrences and this is supported by the posterior ventral temporal cortex. Broadly, our results suggest that the internal features of the categories themselves are key factors in the category learning system.}

      \field{abstract}{Previous work has shown that Ss can learn to classify sets of patterns which are distortions of a prototype, even when they have not seen the prototype. In this paper it is shown that after learning a set of patterns, the prototype (schema) of that set is more easily classified than control patterns which are also within the learned category. As the variability among the memorized patterns increases,so does the ability of Ss to classify highly distorted new instances. These findings argue that information about the schema is abstracted from the stored instan- ces with very high efficiency. It is unclear whether the abstraction of in- formation involved in classifying the schema occurs while learning the original patterns or whether the abstraction process takes place at the time of the first presentation of the schema.}

      \field{abstract}{Data from two experiments show that the experienced structure of a category (i.e., as having high vs. low variability) modulates the impact of context on evaluative judgments of individual exemplars. Target objects (unfamiliar in Experiment 1 and familiar in Experiment 2) were primed with positive and negative images while varying the number (Experiment 1) or typicity (Experiment 2) of exemplars known from a category prior to the judgment task. The results show that evaluations of object valence were more influenced by valenced context cues in high than in low variability category conditions. These results are taken as evidence that more varied exemplar-based category representations facilitate context effects on stimulus evaluation.

      \field{abstract}{The present work examines whether the variability of attitude objects at attitude acquisition increases the generalization of likes and dislikes. In particular, variability might enhance the discriminative learning of cues, resulting in attitudes towards abstract entities rather than concrete instances. Using evaluative conditioning as an experimental paradigm to study attitude acquisition, we manipulated the variability of conditioned stimuli (CSs) that were paired with unconditioned stimuli (USs) of negative or positive valence. CSs resembled Chinese characters that could be grouped into categories by one common component. In the invariable condition, one item per category served as CSs. In the variable condition, multiple items per category were used as CSs. We measured participants' evaluations of the CSs and novel Chinese characters (generalization stimuli), and included a recognition memory task and evaluative measures of CS components. As compared to the invariable condition, the learning condition that introduced variability among CSs facilitated generalization towards novel stimuli, diminished recognition memory performance, and produced evaluative ratings of CS components that were more extreme for common components. The findings suggest the formation of attitudes towards abstract cues rather than concrete instances in the variable relative to the invariable condition, and propose that high variability facilitates the generalization of likes and dislikes. We discuss mechanistic explanations as well as practical implications with regard to the formation of prejudice and intergroup biases.}

      \field{abstract}{Novel sensorimotor situations present a unique challenge to an individual's adaptive ability. Using the simple and easily measured paradigm of visual-motor rearrangement created by the use of visual displacement lenses, we sought to determine whether an individual's ability to adapt to visuo-motor discordance could be improved through training. Subjects threw small balls at a stationary target during a 3-week practice regimen involving repeated exposure to one set of lenses in block practice ({\texttimes}2.0 magnifying lenses), multiple sets of lenses in variable practice ({\texttimes}2.0 magnifying, {\texttimes}0.5 minifying and up--down reversing lenses) or sham lenses. At the end of training, adaptation to a novel visuo-motor situation (20-degree right shift lenses) was tested. We found that (1) training with variable practice can increase adaptability to a novel visuo-motor situation, (2) increased adaptability is retained for at least 1 month and is transferable to further novel visuo-motor permutations and (3) variable practice improves performance of a simple motor task even in the undisturbed state. These results have implications for the design of clinical rehabilitation programs and countermeasures to enhance astronaut adaptability, facilitating adaptive transitions between gravitational environments.}

      \field{abstract}{Training variability has been brought forward as one possible moderator for wider scale transfer effects in cognitive training. However, little is known about which aspects of task variability are important for optimizing training outcomes. This study systematically examined the impact of variability in the different task components on outcome measures, here manipulating content (whether the task stimuli remained fixed or changed between blocks) and the deeper structural task configuration (task sequence: whether the task sequence was fixed or random). Short-term task switching training was implemented with one of four training variability conditions: fixed content{\textbackslash}fixed structure; fixed content{\textbackslash} random structure; varied content{\textbackslash}fixed structure and varied content{\textbackslash}varied structure. The experiment consisted of a baseline block, seven training blocks (learning phase), followed by two transfer blocks, one with fixed and one with random task structure, respectively. In the learning phase, more rapid training gains were observed in the fixed content as compared to varied content. Interestingly, training with fixed content resulted in a trend for costs when transferred to a novel task switching context. In contrast, moderate transfer gains were noted in the varied content condition, manifested specifically on switch trials. These results suggest that task (content) variability is one of the means to improve positive transfer and avoid negative transfer. Additionally, and in agreement with the wide literature on training, this finding suggests that conditions that prevent training gains are in fact beneficial for learning generalization.}

      \field{abstract}{Although the high-variability training method can enhance learning of non-native speech categories, this can depend on individuals' aptitude. The current study asked how general the effects of perceptual aptitude are by testing whether they occur with training materials spoken by native speakers and whether they depend on the nature of the to-be-learned material. Forty-five native Dutch listeners took part in a 5-day training procedure in which they identified bisyllabic Mandarin pseudowords (e.g., asa) pronounced with different lexical tone combinations. The training materials were presented to different groups of listeners at three levels of variability: low (many repetitions of a limited set of words recorded by a single speaker), medium (fewer repetitions of a more variable set of words recorded by three speakers), and high (similar to medium but with five speakers). Overall, variability did not influence learning performance, but this was due to an interaction with individuals' perceptual aptitude: increasing variability hindered improvements in performance for low-aptitude perceivers while it helped improvements in performance for high-aptitude perceivers. These results show that the previously observed interaction between individuals' aptitude and effects of degree of variability extends to natural tokens of Mandarin speech. This interaction was not found, however, in a closely matched study in which native Dutch listeners were trained on the Japanese geminate/singleton consonant contrast. This may indicate that the effectiveness of high-variability training depends not only on individuals' aptitude in speech perception but also on the nature of the categories being acquired.}

      \field{abstract}{Varied training in comparison to consistent training has been shown to benefit transfer to novel conditions within the motor learning paradigm. However, it is unclear if these benefits of variable training extend to complex skills such as driving. Unlike simple motor skills, these complex skills require individuals simultaneously to learn the mapping between ones actions and their consequences and also to integrate this knowledge into continuous and dynamic responses to the changing demands of the environment. In the current work, we compare observed data and an ACT-R model of complex skill acquisition on a navigational video game task (Space Track). Participants trained either on one or two levels of thrust. Performance on a transfer test was better in the varied training conditions in both humans and model. Performance in both humans and model was also differentially influenced by the most recently practiced thrust level. Further analyses revealed large differences between model and human behavior on more detailed measures, which suggests that that the model achieves the same overall performance through different strategies. We discuss these findings and their implications for the ACT-R model of skill acquisition.}

      \field{abstract}{Input variability is key in many aspects of linguistic learning, yet variability increases input complexity, which may cause difficulty in some learning contexts. The current work investigates this trade-off by comparing speaker variability effects on L2 vocabulary learning in different age groups. Existing literature suggests that speaker variability benefits L2 vocabulary learning in adults, but this may not be the case for younger learners. In this study native English-speaking adults, 7- to 8-year-olds, and 10- to 11-year-olds learned six novel Lithuanian words from a single speaker, and six from eight speakers. In line with previous research, adults showed better production of the multispeaker items at test. No such benefit was found for either group of children, either in production or comprehension. Children also had greater difficulties in processing multiple-speaker cues during training. We conclude that age-related capacity limitations may constrain the ability to utilize speaker variability when learning words in a new language.}

      \field{abstract}{Variability is prevalent in early language acquisition, but, whether it supports or hinders learning is unclear; while target variability has been shown to facilitate word learning, variability in competitor items has been shown to make the task harder. Here, we tested whether background variability could boost learning in a referent selection task. Two groups of 2-year-old children saw arrays of one novel and two known objects on a screen, and they heard a novel or known label. Stimuli were identical across conditions, with the exception that in the constant color condition objects appeared on a uniform white background, and in the variable color condition backgrounds were different, uniform colors. At test, only children in the variable condition showed evidence of retaining label-object associations. These data support findings from the adult memory literature, which suggest that variability supports learning by decontextualizing representations. We argue that these data are consistent with dynamic systems accounts of learning in which low-level entropy adds sufficient noise to the developmental system to precipitate a change in behavior.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper is addressed to Schmidt's (1975) schema theory of motor learning. Within this theory, most attention has apparently been given to the variability of practice hypothesis. The hypothesis claims that variable practice is more effective for schema development than constant practice. The empirical foundation of the variability prediction is evaluated here on the basis of 63 relevant studies (mainly journal articles and dissertations), reporting 73 different experiments and covering 12 years of empirical research (from 1975 through 1987). Experiments with adult (n = 48) and with child subjects (n = 25) were distinguished. In the literature, it is often stated that solid empirical support is available for the hypothesis, especially with child subjects. From the review presented here, it was concluded that, firstly, about half of the experiments were factually not addressing the variability prediction, particularly because no learning was evident during practice. Secondly, only limited support favouring the prediction could be obtained from the remaining experiments. The variability prediction cannot, therefore, rest upon consistent supportive evidence, neither with adult nor with child subjects.}

      \field{abstract}{In four experiments, we examined the effects of repetitions and variability on the learning of bird families and metacognitive awareness of such effects. Of particular interest was the accuracy of, and bases for, predictions regarding classification of novel bird species, referred to as category learning judgments (CLJs). Participants studied birds in high repetitions and high variability conditions. These conditions differed in the number of presentations of each bird (repetitions) and the number of unique species from each family (variability). After study, participants made CLJs for each family and were then tested. Results from a classification test revealed repetition benefits for studied species and variability benefits for novel species. In contrast with performance, CLJs did not reflect the benefits of variability. Results showed that CLJs were susceptible to accessibility-based metacognitive illusions produced by additional repetitions of studied items.}

      \field{abstract}{The schema theory of learning predicts that varied training in motor learning should give rise to better transfer than specific training. For example, throwing beanbags during practice to targets 5 and 9ft away should better generalize to targets 7 and 11ft away, as compared to only throwing to a target 7ft away. In this study, we tested this prediction in a throwing task, when the pretest, practice, and posttest were all completed within an hour. Participants in the varied group practiced throwing at 5 and 9ft targets, while participants in the specific group practiced throwing at 7ft only. All participants reliably reduced errors from pretest to posttest. The varied group never outperformed the specific group at the 7ft target (the trained target for the specific group). They did not reliably outperform the specific group at 11ft, either. The numerically better performance at 11ft by the varied group was due, as it turned out in a subsequent experiment, to the fact that 11ft was closer to 9ft (one of the two training targets for the varied group) than to 7ft (the training target for the specific group). We conclude that varied training played a very limited role in short-term motor learning.}

      \field{abstract}{According to the schema theory, variability during practice allows for a larger repertoire of movements to help form a generalized motor program for similar motor skills. Varied training is thought to enhance long-term retention of the motor program due to the heightened difficulty presented. In a highly cited study on this topic, Kerr and Booth (Perceptual and Motor Skills 46 (1978), 395--401) trained two groups of children for 10weeks to throw a beanbag towards either one central target (specific group) or two targets that were {\textpm}1 foot away from the central target (varied group). They found that the varied group performed significantly better than the specific group when both groups were tested at the central target. We, following the same paradigm, trained 30 adults on a similar beanbag throwing task and tested them at various target distances. Our results suggested that after 5--7weeks of training, the specific groups tended to undershoot at longer distances and overshoot at shorter distances while the varied group tended to center their throws around the target at all distances. However, the overall magnitude of error (regardless of over- or undershooting) was similar across groups. We found some support for the hypothesis that the varied group could better generalize to untrained distances, but this advantage was found mainly for the longest distance and disappeared by a posttest held two weeks after practice.}

      \field{abstract}{The present experiments demonstrate that children as young as five years old (M=5:2) generalize beyond their input on the basis of minimal exposure to a novel argument structure construction. The novel construction that was used involved a non-English phrasal pattern: VN1N2, paired with a novel abstract meaning: N2 approaches N1. At the same time, we find that children are keenly sensitive to the input: they show knowledge of the construction after a single day of exposure but this grows stronger after 3days; also, children generalize more readily to new verbs when the input contains more than one verb.}

      \field{abstract}{The present study represented an attempt to determine the extent to which transfer performance on a novel timing task is influenced by contextual similarity (i.e., similar instructions, task requirements, etc.) between training and transfer phases of performance. All subjects were given trials on a task which involved a linear ballistic arm movement. The length of the movement was defined as the distance between a start button and a hinged target, which was knocked over by the subject at the end of the response. During training subjects attempted to produce their movements in a time of 550 ms and were given knowledge of results regarding timing error after each trial. During transfer trials a 300 ms movement time was attempted and no knowledge of results was given. Context was defined by the number of different movement distances performed during training and transfer. Half of the subjects received training trials with a single distance (constant context) while the other half received an equal number of trials with each of three distances (varied context). During the transfer stage of the experiment, subjects either performed in the same movement distance context experienced during training (i.e., constant to constant; varied to varied) or in the opposite context (i.e., constant to varied; varied to constant). The results of the transfer analysis suggested that similariy of context between training and transfer phases of performance was not crucial to the accurate production of a novel closed-timing movement. Implications of the present results for recent theories of memory development are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{The present study attempted to determine whether the nature of training experiences influences the development of coincident timing skill in young children. The task involved visual tracking of a moving light sequence and a 43 cm arm movement to a padded target. Subjects attempted to tap the target coincident with the completion of the light sequence. Sixty first grade children were randomly assigned to one offive groups, with an equal number of males andfemales in each group. Subjects assigned to the training groups received 48 trials on each o f two days, with stimulus speeds that were either slow (179 cm/sec or 4 mph),Jast (313 cmlsec or 7 mph), varied-random (179,224,268,313 cm/secor 4,5,6,7 mph), or varied-blocked (i.e., 6 consecutive trials with one speed before changing to another). Control subjects performed a neutral coloring activity during the training phase of the experiment. All subjects were then given 10 trials on a third day with each of two stimulus speeds not experienced previously; one slow (134 cm/sec or 3 mph) and one fast (358 cm/sec or 8 mph). During transfer trials all groups were more accurate with the fast than with the slow speed stimulus. Training method mattered most during slow speed transfer trials, with the most accurate performance demonstrated by the group receiving varied-blocked speeds during training. The least effective methods werefast speed training, especiallyfor males, and varied-random speed training. it was concluded that training sessionsfor the development of coincident timing skill in young children should emphasize slower speed stimuli and blocking ofadditional speeds which are more rapid.}

      \field{abstract}{In the present study experimental subjects practiced variations in movement distance and/or movement time during training trials on a closed timing task. Control subjects trained with single distance-time combinations. During transfer trials all subjects attempted (without knowledge of results) a distance-time combination that was different (except in the case of one control condition) from any performed during training. The results revealed that the timing accuracy of the two experimental conditions that practiced a variety of times was significantly poorer than that of most of the other conditions during the training phase. However, transfer analyses revealed several significant differences between the performance of variable-trained and constant-trained conditions, in all cases favoring theformer. It was concluded that the transfer benefits of variable practice are (a) not due to the particular movement component selected for variation during training, and (b) to some extentalways determined by the similarity of training and transfer conditions experienced by constant-practice subjects.}

      \field{abstract}{Thepresent investigation was concerned with the variability-of-practice hypothesis of Schmidt's schema theory of motor learning; i.e. it was sought to determine if there is an optimal way to structurethe variable practice session with regard to schema formation. Furthermore,children's motor recognition (movement evaluation) was examined, in addition to recall (movement production), since apparently no such studies had been done within the context of schema theory before. Eighty-eight girls and boys with a mean age of 11.3 years were tested on a throwing task. Three groups of subjects practised under variable conditions (different target distances and weights) that differed with regard to contextual interference and sequential organi,zation of task variations; another group received constant throwing practice. Following practice trials with knowledge of results, the four treatment groups and a control group without prior practice were required to produce and evaluate a novel response (novel target distance and weight) without vision and knowledge of results. The results supported the variability-ofpractice hypothesis, in that variable practice in general facilitated recall and recognition on the novel task. Furthermore, variable practice with the highest level of contextual interference (random order of tasks) produced most effective transfer performance, suggesting that the structure of ihe variable-practice session in fact plays a role with regard to the effectiveness of motor schema development. Contrary to the `organization hypothesis' (Gentile and Nacson, 1976) a hierarchical organization of movement variations was not more beneficial to schema formation than random practice.}

      \field{abstract}{The authors examined variable versus constant practice effects on implicit motor learing in continuous pursuit tracking. On every trial, two thirds of each trial consisted of random patterns,whereas one third was always repeated.Thetracking patterns (including therepeated segment) were linearly scaled in absolute amplitude (Experiment 1) or overall speed (Experiments 1and 2, with the scaling factors being either varied or constant across trialsfor different groups. The repeated segment was generally produced more accuratelythan the 2 random segmentson retention tests and on transfer tests with novel scalings and without participants' awareness of the repetition suggesting that the repeated segment was learned implicitly. Also, learning was generally enhanced by variable practice, as compared with constant practice, suggesting that the advantages of variable overconstant practice found in discrete tasks are generalizable to feedback-regulated trackingtasks.}

      \field{abstract}{The generalization of learned behavior has been extensively investigated, but accounting for variance in generalized responding remains a challenge. Based on recent advances, we demonstrate that the inclusion of perceptual measures in generalization research may lead to a better understanding of both intra- and interindividual differences in generalization. We explore various ways through which perceptual variability can influence generalized responding. We investigate its impact on the ability to discriminate between stimuli and how similarity between stimuli may be variable, rather than fixed, because of it. Subsequently, we argue that perceptual variations can yield different learning experiences and that interindividual differences in generalized responding may be understood from this perspective. Finally, we point to the role of memory and decision-making within this context. Throughout this paper, we argue that accounting for perception in current generalization protocols will improve the precision of obtained generalization gradients and the ability to infer latent mechanisms. This can inspire future attempts to use generalization gradients as a (clinical) predictor or to relate them to individual traits and neural correlates and, ultimately, may lead to new theoretical and clinical insights.}

      \field{abstract}{To generate new movements, we have to generalize what we have learned from previously practiced movements. An important question, therefore, is how the breadth of training affects generalization: does practicing a broad or narrow range of movements lead to better generalization? We address this question with a force field learning experiment. One group adapted while making many reaches in a small region (narrow group), and another group adapted while making reaches in a large region (broad group). Subsequently, both groups were tested for their ability to generalize without visual feedback. Not surprisingly, the narrow group exhibited smaller adaptation errors, yet they did not generalize any better than the broad group. Path errors during generalization were indistinguishable across the two groups, whereas the broad group exhibited reduced terminal errors. These findings indicate that overall, practicing a variety of movements is advantageous for performance during generalization; movement paths are not hindered, and terminal errors are superior. Moreover, the evidence suggests a dissociation between the ability to generalize information about a novel dynamic disturbance, which generalizes narrowly, and the ability to locate the limb accurately in space, which generalizes broadly.}

      \field{abstract}{Building conceptual knowledge that generalizes to novel situations is a key function of human memory. Category-learning paradigms have long been used to understand the mechanisms of knowledge generalization. In the present study, we tested the conditions that promote formation of new concepts. Participants underwent one of six training conditions that differed in the number of examples per category (set size) and their relative similarity to the category average (set coherence). Performance metrics included rates of category learning, ability to generalize categories to new items of varying similarity to prototypes, and recognition memory for individual examples. In categorization, high set coherence led to faster learning and better generalization, while set size had little effect. Recognition did not differ reliably among conditions. We also tested the nature of memory representations used for categorization and recognition decisions using quantitative prototype and exemplar models fit to behavioral responses. Prototype models posit abstract category representations based on the category's central tendency, whereas exemplar models posit that categories are represented by individual category members. Prototype strategy use during categorization increased with increasing set coherence, suggesting that coherent training sets facilitate extraction of commonalities within a category. We conclude that learning from a coherent set of examples is an efficient means of forming abstract knowledge that generalizes broadly.}

      \field{abstract}{When we have learned a motor skill, such as cycling or ice- skating, we can rapidly generalize to novel tasks, such as motorcycling or rollerblading [1--8]. Such facilitation of learning could arise through two distinct mechanisms by which the motor system might adjust its control parameters. First, fast learning could simply be a consequence of the proximity of the original and final settings of the control parameters. Second, by structural learning [9--14], the motor system could constrain the parameter adjustments to conform to the control parameters' covariance structure. Thus, facilitation of learning would rely on the novel task parameters' lying on the structure of a lower-dimensional subspace that can be explored more efficiently. To test between these two hypotheses, we exposed subjects to randomly varying visuomotor tasks of fixed structure. Although such randomly varying tasks are thought to prevent learning, we show that when subsequently pre- sented with novel tasks, subjects exhibit three key features of structural learning: facilitated learning of tasks with the same structure, strong reduction in interference normally observed when switching between tasks that require oppo- site control strategies, and preferential exploration along the learned structure. These results suggest that skill gener- alization relies on task variation and structural learning.}

      \field{abstract}{Acquiring non-native speech contrasts can be difficult. A seminal study by Logan, Lively and Pisoni (1991) established the effectiveness of phonetic training for improving non-native speech perception: Japanese learners of English were trained to perceive /r/-/l/ using minimal pairs over 15 training sessions. A pre/post-test design established learning and generalisation. In a follow-up study, Lively, Logan and Pisoni (1993) presented further evidence which suggested that talker variability in training stimuli was crucial in leading to greater generalisation. These findings have been very influential and ``high variability phonetic training'' is now a standard methodology in the field. However, while the general benefit of phonetic training is well replicated, the evidence for an advantage of high over lower variability training remains mixed. In a large-scale replication of the original studies using updated statistical analyses we test whether learners generalise more after phonetic training using multiple talkers over a single talker. We find that listeners learn in both multiple and single talker conditions. However, in training, we find no difference in how well listeners learn for high vs low variability training. When comparing generalisation to novel talkers after training in relation to pre-training accuracy, we find ambiguous evidence for a high-variability benefit over low-variability training: This means that if a high-variability benefit exists, the effect is much smaller than originally thought, such that it cannot be detected in our sample of 166 listeners.}

      \field{abstract}{An especial skill occurs when performance of a single action from within a class of actions produces an advantage in performance. This advantage in a single action over others in the class is presumed to result from large amounts of practice performing the specific action (Keetch, Schmidt, Lee, \& Young, 2005). In an experiment involving the learning of a basketball set shot, practice was manipulated to identify whether an especial skill effect emerges at the free-throw line as a result of constant practice conditions in novice performers. After a pretest, which involved set shots across five distances, participants were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups. A constant practice group (n=10) performed 300 trials of the set shot at the 15ft free throw line only, whereas a variable practice group (n=10) performed 300 trials across five distances. Shot accuracy increased for both groups as a result of practice at the 15{$\prime$} distance. However, on the posttest, a significant difference was reported between actual and expected scores for the constant practice group only. This finding provided evidence that an effect similar to that seen for especial skills emerges as a result of constant practice. Although an especial skill effect could result from massive amounts of practice, we show it can emerge as a result of short term repetitive practice, indicating that the type, rather than amount, of practice is important.}

      \field{abstract}{This study investigated the ability to generalize acquired skills from training conditions to novel conditions, in a complex perceptual and cognitive task of luggage screening. We examined category and exemplar diversity during training for preparing learners to detect novel items during transfer. Category diversity was manipulated in terms of heterogeneity of training categories: Participants either trained with targets from one category or with targets from several categories. Exemplar diversity was manipulated between participants by presenting either a few or many exemplars for both category diversity conditions. Seventy-two participants were trained to identify threats in pieces of luggage. Thereafter they were transferred to novel stimuli. Results can be summarized in support for the diversity of training hypothesis for preparing for novelty: To the best training for novel luggage screening situations is achieved using fewer items in a variety of categories.

      \field{abstract}{Research in face recognition has tended to focus on discriminating between individuals, or ``telling people apart.'' It has recently become clear that it is also necessary to understand how images of the same person can vary, or ``telling people together.'' Learning a new face, and tracking its representation as it changes from unfamiliar to familiar, involves an abstraction of the variability in different images of that person's face. Here, we present an application of principal components analysis computed across different photos of the same person. We demonstrate that people vary in systematic ways, and that this variability is idiosyncratic---the dimensions of variability in one face do not generalize well to another. Learning a new face therefore entails learning how that face varies. We present evidence for this proposal and suggest that it provides an explanation for various effects in face recognition. We conclude by making a number of testable predictions derived from this framework.}

      \field{abstract}{An assumption of Schmidt's schema theory is that variable practice will enhance the development of schema which will in turn facilitate transfer to situations requiring novel responses. This assumption has been supported in research with both open and closed tasks as defined by Poulton. In an open task-study the novel response was within the range of responses previously experienced by subjects. The present study using an open task concerned whether acquisition of novel responses outside the range of the subjects' past experience would be facilitated by variability of practice. The results confirmed schema theory. Subjects with variable practice showed greater transfer to a novel speed outside the range of training than subjects trained under constant practice. A generalization gradient was obtained. Further the novel conditions were from training conditions, the poorer the transfer a p peared to be. However, generalization decrement was attenuated with variable practice.}

      \field{abstract}{Variability in practice has been shown to enhance motor skill learning. Benefits of practice variability have been attributed to motor schema formation (variable versus constant practice), or more effortful information processing (random versus blocked practice). We hypothesized that, among other mechanisms, greater practice variability might promote an external focus of attention on the intended movement effect, while less variability would be more conducive to a less effective internal focus on body movements. In Experiment 1, the learning of a throwing task was enhanced by variable versus constant practice, and variable group participants reported focusing more on the distance to the target (external focus), while constant group participants focused more on their posture (internal focus). In Experiment 2, golf putting was learned more effectively with a random compared with a blocked practice schedule. Furthermore, random group learners reported using a more effective distal external focus (i.e., distance to the target) to a greater extent, whereas blocked group participants used a less effective proximal focus (i.e., putter) more often. While attentional focus was assessed through questionnaires in the first two experiments, learners in Experiment 3 were asked to report their current attentional focus at any time during practice. Again, the learning of a throwing task was more effective after random relative to blocked practice. Also, random practice learners reported using more external focus cues, while in blocked practice participants used more internal focus cues. The findings suggest that the attentional foci induced by different practice schedules might be at least partially responsible for the learning differences.}

      \field{abstract}{Experiments were conducted in which observers learned to classify simple perceptual stimuli into low-variability and high-variability categories. Similarities between objects were measured in independent psychological-scaling tasks. The results showed that observers classified transfer stimuli into the high-variability categories with greater probability than was predicted by a baseline version of an exemplar-similarity model. Qualitative evidence for the role of category variability on perceptual classification, which could not be explained in terms of the baseline exemplar-similarity model, was obtained as well. Possible accounts of the effects of category variability are considered in the General Discussion section.}

      \field{abstract}{Decision-making is a complex action requiring efficient information processing. Specifically, in movement in which performance efficiency depends on reaction time, e.g., open-loop controlled movements, these processes may play a crucial role. Information processing includes three distinct stages, stimulus identification, response selection, and response programming. Mainly, response selection may play a substantial contribution to the reaction time and appropriate decision making. The duration of this stage depends on the number of possible choices an individual has to ``screen'' to make a proper decision. Given that reaction time is crucial in many sports, the possibilities of reducing it through practice are very tempting. The information processing and its relationship to the manner an individual is practicing are discussed. Especially the variability of practice issues will be explored. In variable practice conditions, an individual has to react to one or more stimuli and has to produce one of the many variations of the same movement or different movements they learned. One has to identify a stimulus appropriately and has to select a response optimally, i.e., choosing from as few choices as possible to reduce the reaction time. On the other hand, in constant practice conditions, an individual can be exposed to one or many stimuli. Still, there is only one variation of the movement that can be executed in the presence of a learned stimulus. Based on the information processing theory and the results of the research focusing on variability of practice, I discuss how the practice conditions may affect reaction time and, as a result, the decision-making process. I conceptually frame the possible implications of practice conditions on decision making related to information processing. In this review, a possible mechanism and relationship between practice conditions and decision-making are presented. Future research directions are presented.}

      \field{abstract}{The ocquisition and transfer effects of contextual interference (Battig, 1979) wereinvestigated on a coincidence anticipation task. The experimental task required subjects to make predictive judgementssothat theirresponses coincided withthearrival ofa light stimulus. Sixtyfemales wereselected from an octivity questionnaire determiningthe extent of experience in similar tasks. One half were selected reporting no experience, and the remaining subjects had prior and present involvement in tasks requiring predictive judgements. Battig's (1979) conceptualization of memory was supportedfor experienced subjects in one transfer task. Experienced subjects who processed the acquisition tasks in high contextual interference (random orderofpresentation) performed signifICantly better than novice subjects in the sameacquisuio>> context. In addition,acquisition under a randomsequencefaciluated transfer to a novel taskfor experienced subjects as compared to acquisiuon under a constant order of presentation. Furthermore, evidence was found to support individual differences in processing. These data strongly supportthat subjects' real worldexperience with motorskills is an important consideration in laboratory research. FinaUy, inclusion of other, more descriptive independent variables is recommended when employingfemales so that differences attributed to gender can be moreproperly attributed to prior experience.}

      \field{abstract}{Abstraction was investigated by examining extrapolation behavior in a function-learning task. During training, participants associated stimulus and response magnitudes (in the form of horizontal bar lengths) that covaried according to a linear, exponential, or quadratic function. After training, novel stimulus magnitudes were presented as tests of extrapolation and interpolation. Participants extrapolated well beyond the range of learned responses, and their responses captured the general shape of the assigned functions, with some systematic deviations. Notable individual differences were observed, particularly in the quadratic condition. The number of unique stimulus--response pairs given during training (i.e., density) was also manipulated but did not affect training or transfer performance. Two rule-learning models, an associative-learning model, and a new hybrid model with associative learning and rule-based responding (extrapolation--association model [EXAM]) were evaluated with respect to the transfer data. EXAM best approximated the overall pattern of extrapolation performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

      \field{abstract}{The purpose of this study was to see how people perceive their own learning during a category learning task, and whether their perceptions matched their performance. In two experiments, participants were asked to learn natural categories, of both high and low variability, and make category learning judgements (CLJs). Variability was manipulated by varying the number of exemplars and the number of times each exemplar was presented within each category. Experiment 1 showed that participants were generally overconfident in their knowledge of low variability families, suggesting that they considered repetition to be more useful for learning than it actually was. Also, a correct trial, for a particular category, was more likely to occur if the previous trial was correct. CLJs had the largest increase when a trial was correct following an incorrect trial and the largest decrease when an incorrect trial followed a correct trial. Experiment 2 replicated these results, but also demonstrated that global CLJ ratings showed the same bias towards repetition. These results indicate that we generally identify success as being the biggest determinant of learning, but do not always recognise cues, such as variability, that enhance learning.}

      \field{abstract}{Fear generalization refers to conditioned fear responses extending to related stimuli and fear overgeneralization is a key feature of pathological anxiety. Along with perception similarity, conceptual relations affect fear generalization. We investigated whether stimulus diversity--an important principle of category-based induc\- tion--influences fear generalization. Induction studies have shown that generalization from a premise involving diverse instances is stronger than that from non-diverse instances. We adopted this framework for fear learning and established two groups. The diverse group developed fear in response to diverse instances from one category, while the non-diverse group acquired fear of non-diverse instances from the same category. An effect of stimulus diversity was observed in shock-expectancy ratings, with the diverse group displaying higher fear generalization than the non-diverse group. We also tested whether intolerance of uncertainty (IU) might affect the difference in fear generalization between the two conditions. Individuals with higher IU showed reduced difference in fear generalization between two conditions, mainly driven by heightened fear generalization to novel stimulus with ambiguous threat levels in the non-diverse condition. This study helps illustrate the mechanisms behind dif\- ferential category-based fear generalization and provides a potential explanation for why higher IU individuals may develop anxiety disorders following trauma.}

      \field{abstract}{The goal of training is to produce learning for a range of activities that are typically more general than the training task itself. Despite a century of research, predicting the scope of learning from the content of training has proven extremely difficult, with the same task producing narrowly focused learning strategies in some cases and broadly scoped learning strategies in others. Here we test the hypothesis that human subjects will prefer a decision strategy that maximizes performance and reduces uncertainty given the demands of the training task and that the strategy chosen will then predict the extent to which learning is transferable. To test this hypothesis, we trained subjects on a moving dot extrapolation task that makes distinct predictions for two types of learning strategy: a narrow model-free strategy that learns an input-output mapping for training stimuli, and a general model-based strategy that utilizes humans' default predictive model for a class of trajectories. When the number of distinct training trajectories is low, we predict better performance for the mapping strategy, but as the number increases, a predictive model is increasingly favored. Consonant with predictions, subject extrapolations for test trajectories were consistent with using a mapping strategy when trained on a small number of training trajectories and a predictive model when trained on a larger number. The general framework developed here can thus be useful both in interpreting previous patterns of task-specific versus task-general learning, as well as in building future training paradigms with certain desired outcomes.}

      \field{abstract}{Classical theories of attention posit that integration of features into object representation (or feature binding) requires engagement of focused attention. Studies challenging this idea have demonstrated that feature binding can happen outside of the focus of attention for familiar objects, as well as for arbitrary color-orientation conjunctions. Detection performance for arbitrary feature conjunction improves with training, suggesting a potential role of perceptual learning mechanisms in the integration of features, a process called ``binding-learning''. In the present study, we investigate whether stimulus variability and task relevance, two critical determinants of visual perceptual learning, also modulate binding-learning. Transfer of learning in a visual search task to a pre-exposed color-orientation conjunction was assessed under conditions of varying stimulus variability and task relevance. We found transfer of learning for the pre-exposed feature conjunctions that were trained with high variability (Experiment 1). Transfer of learning was not observed when the conjunction was rendered taskirrelevant during training due to pop-out targets (Experiment 2). Our findings show that feature binding is determined by principles of perceptual learning, and they support the idea that functions traditionally attributed to goal-driven attention can be grounded in the learning of the statistical structure of the environment.}

      \field{abstract}{Why, when, and how do stereotypes change? This paper develops a computational account based on the principles of structure learning: stereotypes are governed by probabilistic beliefs about the assignment of individuals to groups. Two aspects of this account are particularly important. First, groups are flexibly constructed based on the distribution of traits across individuals; groups are not fixed, nor are they assumed to map on to categories we have to provide to the model. This allows the model to explain the phenomena of group discovery and subtyping, whereby deviant individuals are segregated from a group, thus protecting the group's stereotype. Second, groups are hierarchically structured, such that groups can be nested. This allows the model to explain the phenomenon of subgrouping, whereby a collection of deviant individuals is organized into a refinement of the superordinate group. The structure learning account also sheds light on several factors that determine stereotype change, including perceived group variability, individual typicality, cognitive load, and sample size.}

      \field{abstract}{This study used a forehand hitting task to explore the effect of racket variability on 'out of range' transfer. 48 11-yr.-old girls were randomly assigned to four treatment groups of Random Variability, Blocked Variabhty, Specific, and Control. The experimental groups had 32 trials for 4 successive days after which all groups were tested on 4 transfer conditions. Retention tests were given after 1, 4, and 8 days and the data were examined for treatment, range, and occasion effects. Analysis showed the superiority of practice over no practice, variable over specific practice, and random over blocked variability for transfer with two 'out of range' dimensions. Accuracy decayed between the transfer tests. These results are consistent with schema theory, and it is recommended that physical education teachers should focus variable practice on task dimensions that are new to their classes.}

      \field{abstract}{In climbing, the visual system is confronted with a dual demand: controlling ongoing movement and searching for upcoming movement possibilities. The aims of the present research were: (i) to investigate the effect of different modes of practice on how learners deal with this dual demand; and (ii) to analyze the extent this effect may facilitate transfer of learning to a new climbing route. The effect of a constant practice, an imposed schedule of variations and a self-controlled schedule of variations on the gaze behaviors and the climbing fluency of novices were compared. Results showed that the constant practice group outperformed the imposed variability group on the training route and the three groups climbing fluency on the transfer route did not differ. Analyses of the gaze behaviors showed that the constant practice group used more online gaze control during the last session whereas the imposed variability group relied on a more proactive gaze control. This last gaze pattern was also used on the transfer route by the imposed variability group. Self-controlled variability group displayed more interindividual differences in gaze behaviors. These findings reflect that learning protocols induce different timing for gaze patterns that may differently facilitate adaptation to new climbing routes.}

      \field{abstract}{Studied the abstraction of prototypical information and the development of category breadth or categories defined by low-level distortions from the prototype or by a mixing of distortion levels, using 72 undergraduates. In the uniform-low condition, low-level distortions were classified into 3 categories containing 3, 6, and 9 stimuli; in the mixed condition, an equal number of stimuli at each of 3 distortion levels was classified into categories of sizes 3, 6, and 9. Subsequent transfer to old, new and prototype stimuli was investigated immediately and after delays of 1 and 10 wks. The degree of positive transfer to new instances interacted with category size such that a mixing of distortions resulted in superior transfer for the categories defined by a larger number of stimuli; transfer was greater for the uniform-low condition only when the category was defined by 3 instances. The influence of category size was maintaind across the 10-wk delay for the mixed condition, and, overall, the mixed categories tended to resist deterioration following long delays better than categories defined by low-level distortions.

      \field{abstract}{Face recognition is a challenging classification task that humans perform effortlessly for familiar faces. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of exposure to high variability appearances of the same identity to perform this task. However, these studies did not explicitly measure the perceptual similarity between the learned images and the images presented at test, which may account for the advantage of learning from high variability. Particularly, randomly selected test images are more likely to be perceptually similar to learned high variability images, and dissimilar to learned low variability images. Here we dissociated effects of learning from variability and study-test perceptual similarity, by collecting human similarity ratings for the study and test images. Using these measures, we independently manipulated the variability between the learning images and their perceptual similarity to the test images. Different groups of participants learned face identities from a low or high variability set of images. The learning phase was followed by a face matching test (Experiment 1) or a face recognition task (Experiment 2) that presented novel images of the learned identities that were perceptually dissimilar or similar to the learned images. Results of both experiments show that perceptual similarity between study and test, rather than image variability at learning per se, predicts face recognition. We conclude that learning from high variability improves face recognition for perceptually similar but not for perceptually dissimilar images. These findings may not be specific to faces and should be similarly evaluated for other domains.}

      \field{abstract}{Category variability or diversity is an important factor influencing generalization. However, expectations of category variability may not only depend on the variability of encountered category members but may also be shaped by prior experiences with similar categories. In this study, we investigated whether we could influence category generalization by inducing different category representations in an "A, Non-A" categorization task: Participants either learned about a homogeneous category Non-A or a diverse category Non-A during a priming phase. In order to better understand the transfer process, we varied the nature of the learning phase from implicit transfer to explicit instructions that actively requested that participants use their prior experiences. We found that while with a homogeneous Non-A representation, generalization of the A and Non-A categories was equal, the generalization of category Non-A widened after a priming phase with a diverse representation. In a second experiment, we found that the widening of generalization of category Non-A occurred when the exemplars in this category were themselves diverse (feature-diverse condition) but not when the category contained distinct exemplars (exemplar-diverse condition). These results suggests that categorization is influenced by previous categorization experiences possibly altering the representation of a category. Further, the study gives a hint what kind of heterogeneity is needed to observe the commonly reported broader generalization of diverse categories. The finding has implications not only to understand the influence of prior experiences on category learning, but any cognitive process that hinges on generalization.}

      \field{abstract}{Models of category learning can take two different approaches to representing the relationship between objects and categories. The generative approach solves the categorization problem by building a probabilistic model of each category and using Bayes' rule to infer category labels. In contrast, the discriminative approach directly learns a mapping between inputs and category labels. With this distinction in mind, we revisit a previously studied categorization experiment that showed people are biased towards categorizing objects into a category with higher variability. Modelling results predict that generative learners should be more greatly affected by category variability than discriminative learners. We show that humans can be prompted to adopt either a generative or discriminative approach to learning the same input, resulting in the predicted effect on use of category variability.}

      \field{abstract}{Classic studies of human categorization learning provided evidence that high-variability training in the prototype-distortion paradigm enhances subsequent generalization to novel test patterns from the learned categories. More recent work suggests, however, that when the number of training trials is equated across low-variability and high-variability training conditions, it is low-variability training that yields better generalization performance. Whereas the recent studies used cartoon-animal stimuli varying along binary-valued dimensions, in the present work we return to the use of prototype-distorted dot-pattern stimuli that had been used in the original classic studies. In accord with the recent findings, we observe that high-variability training does not enhance generalization in the dot-pattern prototype-distortion paradigm when the total number of training trials is equated across the conditions, even when training with very large numbers of distinct instances. A baseline version of an exemplar model captures the major qualitative pattern of results in the experiment, as do prototype models that make allowance for changes in parameter settings across the different training conditions. Based on the modeling results, we hypothesize that although high-variability training does not enhance generalization in the prototype-distortion paradigm, it may do so when participants learn more complex category structures.}

      \field{abstract}{The present study reports two experiments in which a total of 20 participants without prior flight experience practiced the final approach phase in a fixed-base simulator. All participants received self-controlled concurrent feedback during 180 practice trials. Experiment 1 shows that participants learn more quickly under variable practice conditions than under constant practice conditions. This finding is attributed to the education of attention to the more useful informational variables: Variability of practice reduces the usefulness of initially used informational variables, which leads to a quicker change in variable use, and hence to a larger improvement in performance. In the practice phase of Experiment 2 variability was selectively applied to some experimental factors but not to others. Participants tended to converge toward the variables that were useful in the specific conditions that they encountered during practice. This indicates that an explanation for variability of practice effects in terms of the education of attention is a useful alternative to traditional explanations based on the notion of the generalized motor program and to explanations based on the notions of noise and local minima.

      \field{abstract}{High phonological neighborhood density has been associated with both advantages and disadvantages in early word learning. High density may support the formation and fine-tuning of new word sound memories---a process termed lexical configuration (e.g., Storkel, 2004). However, new high-density words are also more likely to be misunderstood as instances of known words, and may therefore fail to trigger the learning process (e.g., Swingley \& Aslin, 2007). To examine these apparently contradictory effects, we trained an autoencoder neural network on 587,954 word tokens (5,497 types, including mono- and multisyllabic words of all grammatical classes) spoken by 279 caregivers to English-speaking children aged 18--24 months. We then simulated a communicative development inventory administration and compared network performance to that of 2,292 children aged 18--24 months. We argue that autoencoder performance illustrates concurrent density advantages and disadvantages, in contrast to prior behavioral and computational literature treating such effects independently. Low network error rates signal a configuration advantage for high-density words, while high network error rates signal a triggering advantage for low-density words. This interpretation is consistent with the application of autoencoders in academic research and industry, for simultaneous feature extraction (i.e., configuration) and anomaly detection (i.e., triggering). Autoencoder simulation therefore illustrates how apparently contradictory density and distinctiveness effects can emerge from a common learning mechanism.

      \field{abstract}{Though practice can lead to improved performance in many domains, it is currently unknown how practice affects the deployment of selective attention to filter distracting information. We conducted a series of experiments to address this issue by examining how performance on a task changed after repeated exposure to distractors. Distraction initially slowed response time during task performance, an effect that diminished with repeated exposure to the distractors. When the distractors were consistent in appearance, the practice effect developed quickly but was stimulus-specific. When the distractors were more variable in appearance, the practice effect developed slowly but transferred more readily to other conditions. These data indicate that practice with overcoming distraction leads to improvements in information filtering mechanisms that generalize beyond the training regimen when variable distractor stimuli are experienced.}

      \field{abstract}{To assess the potential effect of specific and varied practice on the development of motor schema, 64 children in two age groups (8 yr. and 12 yr.) were tested on a simple throwing task at the beginning and end of a 12-wk. physical education program. For the throwing test the children were assigned to either a specificity or a schema group (varied practice). The task was performed without visual feedback, but knowledge of results was given after each trial. Prior to both tests at the criterion target, the specific group was given practice throws using the criterion target distance, whereas the schema group practiced on two other targets. No differences were found between the two groups at the beginning of the program but on the posttest those children receiving a variety of practice on the throwing task performed significantly better than the specific-practice group. Thus it was suggested that a varied practice schedule may facilitate the initial formation of motor schema, and this process may be enhanced by participation in a physical education program.}

      \field{abstract}{People often perceive their in-groups as more heterogeneous than their out-groups. We propose an information sampling explanation for this in-group heterogeneity effect. We note that people frequently obtain larger samples of information about in-groups than about out-groups. Using computer simulations, we show that this asymmetry in sample sizes implies the in-group heterogeneity effect under a wide range of assumptions about how experience affects perceived variability. This is the case even when perceived variability is the outcome of rational information processing, implying that the structure of the environment is sufficient to explain the emergence of the in-group heterogeneity effect. A key assumption of our explanation is that perceived group variability depends on the size of the sample observed about this group. We provide evidence in support for this assumption in two experiments. Our results considerably expand the scope and relevance of a prior sampling explanation proposed by Linville, Fischer, and Salovey (1989). They also complement other explanations that proposed that information about in-groups and out-groups is processed differently. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)}

      \field{abstract}{High variability training has been shown to benefit the learning of new face identities. In three experiments, we investigated whether this is also the case for voice identity learning. In Experiment 1a, we contrasted high variability training sets -- which included stimuli extracted from a number of different recording sessions, speaking environments and speaking styles -- with low variability stimulus sets that only included a single speaking style (read speech) extracted from one recording session (see Ritchie \& Burton, 2017 for faces). Listeners were tested on an old/new recognition task using read sentences (i.e. test materials fully overlapped with the low variability training stimuli) and we found a high variability disadvantage. In Experiment 1b, listeners were trained in a similar way, however, now there was no overlap in speaking style or recording session between training sets and test stimuli. Here, we found a high variability advantage. In Experiment 2, variability was manipulated in terms of the number of unique items as opposed to number of unique speaking styles. Here, we contrasted the high variability training sets used in Experiment 1a with low variability training sets that included the same breadth of styles, but fewer unique items; instead, individual items were repeated (see Murphy, Ipser, Gaigg, \& Cook, 2015 for faces). We found only weak evidence for a high variability advantage, which could be explained by stimulus-specific effects. We propose that high variability advantages may be particularly pronounced when listeners are required to generalise from trained stimuli to different-sounding, previously unheard stimuli. We discuss these findings in the context of mechanisms thought to underpin advantages for high variability training.}

      \field{abstract}{In property induction tasks, encountering a diverse range of instances (e.g., hippos and hamsters) with a given property usually increases our willingness to generalise that property to a novel instance, relative to non-diverse evidence (e.g., hippos and rhinos). Although generalisation in property induction and predictive learning tasks share conceptual similarities, it is unknown whether this diversity principle applies to generalisation of a predictive association. We tested this hypothesis in two predictive learning experiments using differential training where one category of stimuli (e.g., fruits) predicted an outcome and another category (e.g., vegetables) predicted no outcome. We compared generalisation between a Non-Diverse group who were presented with non-diverse evidence in both positive (predicted the outcome) and negative (predicted no outcome) categories, and two groups who received the same training as the Non-Diverse group but with a more diverse range of exemplars in the positive (Diverse+ group) or negative (Diverse-- group) category. Diversity effects were found for both positive and negative categories, in that learning about a diverse range of exemplars increased generalisation of a predictive association to novel exemplars from that same category. The results suggest that diversity, a key principle describing how we reason inductively, also applies to generalisation in associative learning tasks.}

      \field{abstract}{Two studies are reported that support the hypothesis that categories that require a multiple-unit, as opposed to a single-unit, representation lead to worse initial acquisition but better generalization. On the basis of the constraints imposed by the procedural-based learning system thought to mediate information-integration categorization, we argue that the need to train multiple units during initial category acquisition slows the procedural-based category learning process and adversely affects learning performance. However, we speculate that better generalization occurs because of the increased likelihood that a novel stimulus will activate at least one of the multiple units needed to represent the category. Relations to other findings in the literature and the implications of this work for training and clinical assessment are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{People are poor at matching the identity of unfamiliar faces, but very good at identifying familiar faces. Theoretical accounts suggest that representations derived from exposure to variation are instrumental in driving this familiarity based improvement. In support of this, recent work shows that providing multiple photographs of an unfamiliar face improves identity verification accuracy. Here, we test whether the extent of variation is critical to this improvement, by manipulating the degree of within-identity variation that participants are exposed to in a sequential matching test. Participants were more accurate and adopted more liberal response criteria, when matching high-variability pairs to probe images, compared with either low-variability pairs or single images. Importantly, benefits of variation are not explained by independent contributions of single images, suggesting that people extrapolate information across images to produce gains in identification accuracy. These results suggest that photo-ID can be improved by incorporating broader ranges of variation in facial appearance.}

      \field{abstract}{One aspect of human vision unmatched by machines is the capacity to generalize from few samples. Observers tend to know when novel objects are in the same class despite large differences in shape, material or viewpoint. A major challenge in studying such generalization is that participants can see each novel sample only once. To overcome this, we used crowdsourcing to obtain responses from 500 human observers on 20 novel object classes, with each stimulus compared to 1 or 16 related objects. The results reveal that humans generalize from sparse data in highly systematic ways with the number and variance of the samples. We compared human responses to `ShapeComp', an image-computable model based on {$>$}100 shape descriptors, and `AlexNet', a convolution neural network that roughly matches humans at recognizing 1000 categories of real-world objects. With 16 samples, the models were consistent with human responses without free parameters. Thus, when there are a sufficient number of samples, observers rely on shallow but efficient processes based on a fixed set of features. With 1 sample, however, the models required different feature weights for each object. This suggests that one-shot categorization involves more sophisticated processes that actively identify the unique characteristics underlying each object class.}

      \field{abstract}{The present study examined the effect of stimulus variability and practice order on generalization to novel stimuli following a single session of response inhibition training. Ninety-six young adults practiced the Go/No-go task online in three training conditions: (1) constant (N\,=\,32)---inhibition practiced on one stimulus; (2) variable-blocked (N\,=\,32)---inhibition practiced on 6 stimuli, each in a separate block; and (3) variable-random (N\,=\,32)---inhibition practiced on 6 stimuli in random order. Generalization was measured by comparing groups on inhibition of novel stimuli and a trained stimulus immediately and 24~h after training. Consistent with our hypothesis, the variable-random and the variable-blocked groups showed better generalization to the novel items than the constant group, demonstrating the benefit of stimulus variability. The variable-random group also showed better generalization than the variable-blocked group, demonstrating the benefit of presenting stimuli in random order. Participants' capacity for working memory maintenance was found to modulate the effect of practice order. While the benefit of variability was retained 24~h after training, the effect of order was not. Results also show generalization to (1) different type of stimuli using the same task and (2) the same stimuli on a different response inhibition task (the Stop-Signal Task), however, the effect of variable practice and order were not evident in these cases. The study findings illustrate the advantage of using variable stimuli presented in random order for generalization and suggest that these principles of motor learning can be applied to learning of cognitive skills.}

      \field{abstract}{In table tennis the follow-through action after a shot is an important part of skill execution. In this experiment, we aimed to extend literature around the contextual interference effect by investigating whether the way the follow-through is organised in practice affects learning of the backhand shot in table tennis. Thirty unskilled participants were allocated to blocked-variable practice, random-variable practice or a control-constant group and aimed backhand shots towards a target following ball projection from a machine. Each group completed these shots in a pre-test, a training phase with follow-through manipulations, a post-test, and a retention test. The random-variable group improved their shot accuracy from pre-test to post-test and from pre-test to retention test (both P {$<$} 0.01, d = 1.03), whereas neither the blocked-variable nor the control-constant group displayed any change in shot accuracy. Practising the follow-through in a random-variable fashion enhanced learning of the preceding shot compared with blocked-variable practice or no follow-through instructions. The benefits of learning motor skills under conditions of high contextual interference also apply to how follow-through actions are organised. The findings are valuable to coaches and suggest that instructions related to the follow-through action should be considered as well as the primary skill itself.}

      \field{abstract}{A unified quantitative approach to modeling Ss' identification and categorization of multidimensional perceptual stimuli is proposed and tested. Two Ss identified and categorized the same set of perceptually confusable stimuli varying on separable dimensions. The identification data were modeled using R. N. Shepard's (see record 1959-05134-001) multidimensional scaling-choice framework, which was then extended to model the Ss' categorization performance. The categorization model, which generalizes the context theory of classification developed by D. L. Medin and M. M. Schaffer (see record 1979-12633-001), assumes that Ss store category exemplars in memory. Classification decisions are based on the similarity of stimuli to the stored exemplars. It is assumed that the same multidimensional perceptual representation underlies performance in both the identification and categorization paradigms. However, because of the influence of selective attention, similarity relationships change systematically across the 2 paradigms. Findings provide some support for the hypothesis that Ss distribute attention among component dimensions so as to optimize categorization performance and that Ss may have augmented their category representations with inferred exemplars. Results demonstrate that excellent predictions of categorization performance can be made given knowledge of performance in an identification paradigm.}

      \field{abstract}{Under the guidance of a formal exemplar model of categorization, we conduct comparisons of natural-science classification learning across four conditions in which the nature of the training examples is manipulated. The specific domain of inquiry is rock classification in the geologic sciences; the goal is to use the model to search for optimal training examples for teaching the rock categories. On the positive side, the model makes a number of successful predictions: Most notably, compared with conditions involving focused training on small sets of training examples, generalization to novel transfer items is significantly enhanced in a condition in which learners experience a broad swath of training examples from each category. Nevertheless, systematic departures from the model predictions are also observed. Further analyses lead us to the hypothesis that the high-dimensional featurespace representation derived for the rock stimuli (to which the exemplar model makes reference) systematically underestimates within-category similarities. We suggest that this limitation is likely to arise in numerous situations in which investigators attempt to build detailed feature-space representations for naturalistic categories. A low-parameter extended version of the model that adjusts for this limitation provides dramatically improved accounts of performance across the four conditions. We outline future steps for enhancing the current feature-space representation and continuing our goal of using formal psychological models to guide the search for effective methods of teaching science categories.}

      \field{abstract}{Constant and variable practice conditions have been hypothesized to lead to different learning outcomes between them but similar within. However, experiments have found that within a constant practice condition, participants can show highly individual outcomes (i.e., coordination functions). Considering the contradictory evidence on the effects of variable practice, we tested the idea that measures of the individual learned outcome would be required to provide a full explanation for results in transfer tests rather than or in addition to the group task-related conditions on which individuals practiced. Twenty-four participants were divided into three groups with different practice conditions (constant, varied distance of the target, and varied angle of the target) and for 5 days performed a task of throwing for precision to a target. Pre-, post-, and transfer tests were used to evaluate our hypothesis. The results showed that although the group measures could predict certain aspects of the transfer tests, the coordination function characteristics were required to show higher levels of explanatory power. This finding supports the view that learning involves a specific, individual and generalizable solution although there are aspects of learning that are specific to the condition of practice.}

      \field{abstract}{We conducted two experiments to investigate the acquisition and representation of social categories, with an emphasis on the perception of variability of group members. In Experiment 1, subjects learned about a group that was sociable and intelligent and either high or low in variability with respect to these attributes. Differences in the actual variability of group members were reflected in subjects' estimates of variability, in their tendency to generalize from the traits and goals of a single member to the entire group, and in their classification judgments of new instances, which reflected their expectations of group members' future behavior. Memory for instances of the category also played a role in these judgment tasks. In Experiment 2, subjects who first learned about the behaviors performed by group members and then about general characteristics of the group perceived the group as more variable than did those who learned the same information in the reverse order. In both experiments, we manipulated memory for specific behaviors such that either the most extreme behaviors or behaviors at the center of the distribution were most memorable. This manipulation did not afiect estimates of perceived variability, suggesting that these were constructed and stored on-line rather than from a retrieved set of category exemplars.}

      \field{abstract}{The issue of how category variability affects classification of novel instances is an important one for assessing theories of categorization, yet previous research cannot provide a compelling conclusion. In five experiments we re-examine some of the factors which are thought to affect participant performance. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants almost always classified the test item as belonging to the high-variability category. By contrast, in Experiment 3 we employed an alternative experimental paradigm, where the difference in variability of the two categories was less salient. In that case, participants tended to classify a test item as belonging to the low-variability category. Two additional experiments (4 and 5) explored in detail the differences between Experiments 1, 2 on the one hand, and 3 on the other. Some insight into the underlying psychological processes can be provided by computational models of categorization, and we focus on the continuous version of Anderson's (1991) Rational Model, which has not been explored before in this context. The model predicts that test instances exactly halfway between the prototypes of two categories should be classified into the more variable category, consistent with the bulk of empirical findings. We also provided a comparison with a slightly reduced version of the Generalized Context Model (GCM) to show that its predictions are consistent with those from the Rational Model, for our stimulus sets.}

      \field{abstract}{Research suggests variability supports successful categorization, however, the scope of variability's support at the level of higher-order generalization remains unexplored. A longitudinal study examined the role of exemplar variability in first- and second-order generalization in the context of early nominal-category learning. Sixteen eighteen-month-old children were taught twelve categories. Half were taught with sets of highly similar exemplars; half with sets of more variable exemplars. Participants' learning and generalization of trained labels and their development of more general word-learning biases were tested. All children learned labels for trained exemplars, but children trained with variable exemplars generalized to novel exemplars of these categories, developed a discriminating word-learning bias generalizing labels of novel solid objects by shape and nonsolids by material, and accelerated in vocabulary acquisition. These data demonstrate that variability leads to better abstraction of individual and global category organization, increasing learning outside the laboratory.}

      \field{abstract}{The generality of the variability in practice prediction, arising from Schmidt's schema theory (1975) of motor learning was tested on young children. More specifically, the structure of the variability session and its subsequent influence on transfer performance to a novel variation of the task was examined. Children tossed a weighted bean bag to a fixed target location. Three groups experienced variability in practice with four bean bags of varying weights (3,4,5, and 6 oz.); however, the trial-by-trial presentation of each weight was different for each group. One group received a random presentation of each weight from trial to trial while another experienced random presentations of a weight for blocks of three trials. The third variability group received blocked practice with six trials per blockfor each weight. All variability groups experienced the same amount of practice at each weight. A constant practice group experienced only a single weight. Following 24 practice trials, all subjects transferred outside the range of previous experience, receiving three trials with one of two possible test weights (2 oz. or 7 oz.). The results indicated that the variability group practicing with blocks of three trials at each variation led to superior performance at transfer to novel variations of the task. Overall, the experiment suggested that transfer performance for children is affected by the appropriate structure of variable practice which formulates the schemata for movement production.}

      \field{abstract}{Abstract Objects are grouped into categories through a complex combination of statistical and structural regularities. We sought to better understand the neural responses to the structural features of object categories that result from implicit learning. Adult participants were exposed to 32 object categories that contained three structural properties: frequency, variability, and co-occurrences, during an implicit learning task. After this exposure, participants completed a recognition task and were then presented with blocks of learned object categories during fMRI sessions. Analyses were performed by extracting data from ROIs placed throughout the fusiform gyri and lateral occipital cortex and comparing the effects of the different structural properties throughout the ROIs. Behaviorally, we found that symbol category recognition was supported by frequency, but not variability. Neurally, we found that sensitivity to object categories was greater in the right hemisphere and increased as ROIs were moved posteriorly. Frequency and variability altered the brain activation while processing object categories, although the presence of learned co-occurrences did not. Moreover, variability and co-occurrence interacted as a function of ROI, with the posterior fusiform gyrus being most sensitive to this relationship. This result suggests that variability may guide the learner to relevant co-occurrences and this is supported by the posterior ventral temporal cortex. Broadly, our results suggest that the internal features of the categories themselves are key factors in the category learning system.}

      \field{abstract}{Previous work has shown that Ss can learn to classify sets of patterns which are distortions of a prototype, even when they have not seen the prototype. In this paper it is shown that after learning a set of patterns, the prototype (schema) of that set is more easily classified than control patterns which are also within the learned category. As the variability among the memorized patterns increases,so does the ability of Ss to classify highly distorted new instances. These findings argue that information about the schema is abstracted from the stored instan- ces with very high efficiency. It is unclear whether the abstraction of in- formation involved in classifying the schema occurs while learning the original patterns or whether the abstraction process takes place at the time of the first presentation of the schema.}

      \field{abstract}{Data from two experiments show that the experienced structure of a category (i.e., as having high vs. low variability) modulates the impact of context on evaluative judgments of individual exemplars. Target objects (unfamiliar in Experiment 1 and familiar in Experiment 2) were primed with positive and negative images while varying the number (Experiment 1) or typicity (Experiment 2) of exemplars known from a category prior to the judgment task. The results show that evaluations of object valence were more influenced by valenced context cues in high than in low variability category conditions. These results are taken as evidence that more varied exemplar-based category representations facilitate context effects on stimulus evaluation.

      \field{abstract}{The present work examines whether the variability of attitude objects at attitude acquisition increases the generalization of likes and dislikes. In particular, variability might enhance the discriminative learning of cues, resulting in attitudes towards abstract entities rather than concrete instances. Using evaluative conditioning as an experimental paradigm to study attitude acquisition, we manipulated the variability of conditioned stimuli (CSs) that were paired with unconditioned stimuli (USs) of negative or positive valence. CSs resembled Chinese characters that could be grouped into categories by one common component. In the invariable condition, one item per category served as CSs. In the variable condition, multiple items per category were used as CSs. We measured participants' evaluations of the CSs and novel Chinese characters (generalization stimuli), and included a recognition memory task and evaluative measures of CS components. As compared to the invariable condition, the learning condition that introduced variability among CSs facilitated generalization towards novel stimuli, diminished recognition memory performance, and produced evaluative ratings of CS components that were more extreme for common components. The findings suggest the formation of attitudes towards abstract cues rather than concrete instances in the variable relative to the invariable condition, and propose that high variability facilitates the generalization of likes and dislikes. We discuss mechanistic explanations as well as practical implications with regard to the formation of prejudice and intergroup biases.}

      \field{abstract}{Novel sensorimotor situations present a unique challenge to an individual's adaptive ability. Using the simple and easily measured paradigm of visual-motor rearrangement created by the use of visual displacement lenses, we sought to determine whether an individual's ability to adapt to visuo-motor discordance could be improved through training. Subjects threw small balls at a stationary target during a 3-week practice regimen involving repeated exposure to one set of lenses in block practice ({\texttimes}2.0 magnifying lenses), multiple sets of lenses in variable practice ({\texttimes}2.0 magnifying, {\texttimes}0.5 minifying and up--down reversing lenses) or sham lenses. At the end of training, adaptation to a novel visuo-motor situation (20-degree right shift lenses) was tested. We found that (1) training with variable practice can increase adaptability to a novel visuo-motor situation, (2) increased adaptability is retained for at least 1 month and is transferable to further novel visuo-motor permutations and (3) variable practice improves performance of a simple motor task even in the undisturbed state. These results have implications for the design of clinical rehabilitation programs and countermeasures to enhance astronaut adaptability, facilitating adaptive transitions between gravitational environments.}

      \field{abstract}{Training variability has been brought forward as one possible moderator for wider scale transfer effects in cognitive training. However, little is known about which aspects of task variability are important for optimizing training outcomes. This study systematically examined the impact of variability in the different task components on outcome measures, here manipulating content (whether the task stimuli remained fixed or changed between blocks) and the deeper structural task configuration (task sequence: whether the task sequence was fixed or random). Short-term task switching training was implemented with one of four training variability conditions: fixed content{\textbackslash}fixed structure; fixed content{\textbackslash} random structure; varied content{\textbackslash}fixed structure and varied content{\textbackslash}varied structure. The experiment consisted of a baseline block, seven training blocks (learning phase), followed by two transfer blocks, one with fixed and one with random task structure, respectively. In the learning phase, more rapid training gains were observed in the fixed content as compared to varied content. Interestingly, training with fixed content resulted in a trend for costs when transferred to a novel task switching context. In contrast, moderate transfer gains were noted in the varied content condition, manifested specifically on switch trials. These results suggest that task (content) variability is one of the means to improve positive transfer and avoid negative transfer. Additionally, and in agreement with the wide literature on training, this finding suggests that conditions that prevent training gains are in fact beneficial for learning generalization.}

      \field{abstract}{Although the high-variability training method can enhance learning of non-native speech categories, this can depend on individuals' aptitude. The current study asked how general the effects of perceptual aptitude are by testing whether they occur with training materials spoken by native speakers and whether they depend on the nature of the to-be-learned material. Forty-five native Dutch listeners took part in a 5-day training procedure in which they identified bisyllabic Mandarin pseudowords (e.g., asa) pronounced with different lexical tone combinations. The training materials were presented to different groups of listeners at three levels of variability: low (many repetitions of a limited set of words recorded by a single speaker), medium (fewer repetitions of a more variable set of words recorded by three speakers), and high (similar to medium but with five speakers). Overall, variability did not influence learning performance, but this was due to an interaction with individuals' perceptual aptitude: increasing variability hindered improvements in performance for low-aptitude perceivers while it helped improvements in performance for high-aptitude perceivers. These results show that the previously observed interaction between individuals' aptitude and effects of degree of variability extends to natural tokens of Mandarin speech. This interaction was not found, however, in a closely matched study in which native Dutch listeners were trained on the Japanese geminate/singleton consonant contrast. This may indicate that the effectiveness of high-variability training depends not only on individuals' aptitude in speech perception but also on the nature of the categories being acquired.}

      \field{abstract}{Varied training in comparison to consistent training has been shown to benefit transfer to novel conditions within the motor learning paradigm. However, it is unclear if these benefits of variable training extend to complex skills such as driving. Unlike simple motor skills, these complex skills require individuals simultaneously to learn the mapping between ones actions and their consequences and also to integrate this knowledge into continuous and dynamic responses to the changing demands of the environment. In the current work, we compare observed data and an ACT-R model of complex skill acquisition on a navigational video game task (Space Track). Participants trained either on one or two levels of thrust. Performance on a transfer test was better in the varied training conditions in both humans and model. Performance in both humans and model was also differentially influenced by the most recently practiced thrust level. Further analyses revealed large differences between model and human behavior on more detailed measures, which suggests that that the model achieves the same overall performance through different strategies. We discuss these findings and their implications for the ACT-R model of skill acquisition.}

      \field{abstract}{Input variability is key in many aspects of linguistic learning, yet variability increases input complexity, which may cause difficulty in some learning contexts. The current work investigates this trade-off by comparing speaker variability effects on L2 vocabulary learning in different age groups. Existing literature suggests that speaker variability benefits L2 vocabulary learning in adults, but this may not be the case for younger learners. In this study native English-speaking adults, 7- to 8-year-olds, and 10- to 11-year-olds learned six novel Lithuanian words from a single speaker, and six from eight speakers. In line with previous research, adults showed better production of the multispeaker items at test. No such benefit was found for either group of children, either in production or comprehension. Children also had greater difficulties in processing multiple-speaker cues during training. We conclude that age-related capacity limitations may constrain the ability to utilize speaker variability when learning words in a new language.}

      \field{abstract}{Variability is prevalent in early language acquisition, but, whether it supports or hinders learning is unclear; while target variability has been shown to facilitate word learning, variability in competitor items has been shown to make the task harder. Here, we tested whether background variability could boost learning in a referent selection task. Two groups of 2-year-old children saw arrays of one novel and two known objects on a screen, and they heard a novel or known label. Stimuli were identical across conditions, with the exception that in the constant color condition objects appeared on a uniform white background, and in the variable color condition backgrounds were different, uniform colors. At test, only children in the variable condition showed evidence of retaining label-object associations. These data support findings from the adult memory literature, which suggest that variability supports learning by decontextualizing representations. We argue that these data are consistent with dynamic systems accounts of learning in which low-level entropy adds sufficient noise to the developmental system to precipitate a change in behavior.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper is addressed to Schmidt's (1975) schema theory of motor learning. Within this theory, most attention has apparently been given to the variability of practice hypothesis. The hypothesis claims that variable practice is more effective for schema development than constant practice. The empirical foundation of the variability prediction is evaluated here on the basis of 63 relevant studies (mainly journal articles and dissertations), reporting 73 different experiments and covering 12 years of empirical research (from 1975 through 1987). Experiments with adult (n = 48) and with child subjects (n = 25) were distinguished. In the literature, it is often stated that solid empirical support is available for the hypothesis, especially with child subjects. From the review presented here, it was concluded that, firstly, about half of the experiments were factually not addressing the variability prediction, particularly because no learning was evident during practice. Secondly, only limited support favouring the prediction could be obtained from the remaining experiments. The variability prediction cannot, therefore, rest upon consistent supportive evidence, neither with adult nor with child subjects.}

      \field{abstract}{In four experiments, we examined the effects of repetitions and variability on the learning of bird families and metacognitive awareness of such effects. Of particular interest was the accuracy of, and bases for, predictions regarding classification of novel bird species, referred to as category learning judgments (CLJs). Participants studied birds in high repetitions and high variability conditions. These conditions differed in the number of presentations of each bird (repetitions) and the number of unique species from each family (variability). After study, participants made CLJs for each family and were then tested. Results from a classification test revealed repetition benefits for studied species and variability benefits for novel species. In contrast with performance, CLJs did not reflect the benefits of variability. Results showed that CLJs were susceptible to accessibility-based metacognitive illusions produced by additional repetitions of studied items.}

      \field{abstract}{The schema theory of learning predicts that varied training in motor learning should give rise to better transfer than specific training. For example, throwing beanbags during practice to targets 5 and 9ft away should better generalize to targets 7 and 11ft away, as compared to only throwing to a target 7ft away. In this study, we tested this prediction in a throwing task, when the pretest, practice, and posttest were all completed within an hour. Participants in the varied group practiced throwing at 5 and 9ft targets, while participants in the specific group practiced throwing at 7ft only. All participants reliably reduced errors from pretest to posttest. The varied group never outperformed the specific group at the 7ft target (the trained target for the specific group). They did not reliably outperform the specific group at 11ft, either. The numerically better performance at 11ft by the varied group was due, as it turned out in a subsequent experiment, to the fact that 11ft was closer to 9ft (one of the two training targets for the varied group) than to 7ft (the training target for the specific group). We conclude that varied training played a very limited role in short-term motor learning.}

      \field{abstract}{According to the schema theory, variability during practice allows for a larger repertoire of movements to help form a generalized motor program for similar motor skills. Varied training is thought to enhance long-term retention of the motor program due to the heightened difficulty presented. In a highly cited study on this topic, Kerr and Booth (Perceptual and Motor Skills 46 (1978), 395--401) trained two groups of children for 10weeks to throw a beanbag towards either one central target (specific group) or two targets that were {\textpm}1 foot away from the central target (varied group). They found that the varied group performed significantly better than the specific group when both groups were tested at the central target. We, following the same paradigm, trained 30 adults on a similar beanbag throwing task and tested them at various target distances. Our results suggested that after 5--7weeks of training, the specific groups tended to undershoot at longer distances and overshoot at shorter distances while the varied group tended to center their throws around the target at all distances. However, the overall magnitude of error (regardless of over- or undershooting) was similar across groups. We found some support for the hypothesis that the varied group could better generalize to untrained distances, but this advantage was found mainly for the longest distance and disappeared by a posttest held two weeks after practice.}

      \field{abstract}{The present experiments demonstrate that children as young as five years old (M=5:2) generalize beyond their input on the basis of minimal exposure to a novel argument structure construction. The novel construction that was used involved a non-English phrasal pattern: VN1N2, paired with a novel abstract meaning: N2 approaches N1. At the same time, we find that children are keenly sensitive to the input: they show knowledge of the construction after a single day of exposure but this grows stronger after 3days; also, children generalize more readily to new verbs when the input contains more than one verb.}

      \field{abstract}{The present study represented an attempt to determine the extent to which transfer performance on a novel timing task is influenced by contextual similarity (i.e., similar instructions, task requirements, etc.) between training and transfer phases of performance. All subjects were given trials on a task which involved a linear ballistic arm movement. The length of the movement was defined as the distance between a start button and a hinged target, which was knocked over by the subject at the end of the response. During training subjects attempted to produce their movements in a time of 550 ms and were given knowledge of results regarding timing error after each trial. During transfer trials a 300 ms movement time was attempted and no knowledge of results was given. Context was defined by the number of different movement distances performed during training and transfer. Half of the subjects received training trials with a single distance (constant context) while the other half received an equal number of trials with each of three distances (varied context). During the transfer stage of the experiment, subjects either performed in the same movement distance context experienced during training (i.e., constant to constant; varied to varied) or in the opposite context (i.e., constant to varied; varied to constant). The results of the transfer analysis suggested that similariy of context between training and transfer phases of performance was not crucial to the accurate production of a novel closed-timing movement. Implications of the present results for recent theories of memory development are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{The present study attempted to determine whether the nature of training experiences influences the development of coincident timing skill in young children. The task involved visual tracking of a moving light sequence and a 43 cm arm movement to a padded target. Subjects attempted to tap the target coincident with the completion of the light sequence. Sixty first grade children were randomly assigned to one offive groups, with an equal number of males andfemales in each group. Subjects assigned to the training groups received 48 trials on each o f two days, with stimulus speeds that were either slow (179 cm/sec or 4 mph),Jast (313 cmlsec or 7 mph), varied-random (179,224,268,313 cm/secor 4,5,6,7 mph), or varied-blocked (i.e., 6 consecutive trials with one speed before changing to another). Control subjects performed a neutral coloring activity during the training phase of the experiment. All subjects were then given 10 trials on a third day with each of two stimulus speeds not experienced previously; one slow (134 cm/sec or 3 mph) and one fast (358 cm/sec or 8 mph). During transfer trials all groups were more accurate with the fast than with the slow speed stimulus. Training method mattered most during slow speed transfer trials, with the most accurate performance demonstrated by the group receiving varied-blocked speeds during training. The least effective methods werefast speed training, especiallyfor males, and varied-random speed training. it was concluded that training sessionsfor the development of coincident timing skill in young children should emphasize slower speed stimuli and blocking ofadditional speeds which are more rapid.}

      \field{abstract}{In the present study experimental subjects practiced variations in movement distance and/or movement time during training trials on a closed timing task. Control subjects trained with single distance-time combinations. During transfer trials all subjects attempted (without knowledge of results) a distance-time combination that was different (except in the case of one control condition) from any performed during training. The results revealed that the timing accuracy of the two experimental conditions that practiced a variety of times was significantly poorer than that of most of the other conditions during the training phase. However, transfer analyses revealed several significant differences between the performance of variable-trained and constant-trained conditions, in all cases favoring theformer. It was concluded that the transfer benefits of variable practice are (a) not due to the particular movement component selected for variation during training, and (b) to some extentalways determined by the similarity of training and transfer conditions experienced by constant-practice subjects.}

      \field{abstract}{Thepresent investigation was concerned with the variability-of-practice hypothesis of Schmidt's schema theory of motor learning; i.e. it was sought to determine if there is an optimal way to structurethe variable practice session with regard to schema formation. Furthermore,children's motor recognition (movement evaluation) was examined, in addition to recall (movement production), since apparently no such studies had been done within the context of schema theory before. Eighty-eight girls and boys with a mean age of 11.3 years were tested on a throwing task. Three groups of subjects practised under variable conditions (different target distances and weights) that differed with regard to contextual interference and sequential organi,zation of task variations; another group received constant throwing practice. Following practice trials with knowledge of results, the four treatment groups and a control group without prior practice were required to produce and evaluate a novel response (novel target distance and weight) without vision and knowledge of results. The results supported the variability-ofpractice hypothesis, in that variable practice in general facilitated recall and recognition on the novel task. Furthermore, variable practice with the highest level of contextual interference (random order of tasks) produced most effective transfer performance, suggesting that the structure of ihe variable-practice session in fact plays a role with regard to the effectiveness of motor schema development. Contrary to the `organization hypothesis' (Gentile and Nacson, 1976) a hierarchical organization of movement variations was not more beneficial to schema formation than random practice.}

On every trial, two thirds of each trial consisted of random patterns,whereas one third was always repeated.Thetracking patterns (including therepeated segment) were linearly scaled in absolute amplitude (Experiment 1) or overall speed (Experiments 1and 2, with the scaling factors being either varied or constant across trialsfor different groups. The repeated segment was generally produced more accuratelythan the 2 random segmentson retention tests and on transfer tests with novel scalings and without participants' awareness of the repetition suggesting that the repeated segment was learned implicitly. Also, learning was generally enhanced by variable practice, as compared with constant practice, suggesting that the advantages of variable overconstant practice found in discrete tasks are generalizable to feedback-regulated trackingtasks.}

      \field{abstract}{The generalization of learned behavior has been extensively investigated, but accounting for variance in generalized responding remains a challenge. Based on recent advances, we demonstrate that the inclusion of perceptual measures in generalization research may lead to a better understanding of both intra- and interindividual differences in generalization. We explore various ways through which perceptual variability can influence generalized responding. We investigate its impact on the ability to discriminate between stimuli and how similarity between stimuli may be variable, rather than fixed, because of it. Subsequently, we argue that perceptual variations can yield different learning experiences and that interindividual differences in generalized responding may be understood from this perspective. Finally, we point to the role of memory and decision-making within this context. Throughout this paper, we argue that accounting for perception in current generalization protocols will improve the precision of obtained generalization gradients and the ability to infer latent mechanisms. This can inspire future attempts to use generalization gradients as a (clinical) predictor or to relate them to individual traits and neural correlates and, ultimately, may lead to new theoretical and clinical insights.}
