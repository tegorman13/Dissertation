My mental model of Intro/Lit_Review
- Learning Input - properties that influence or benefit learning
- Variability
	- what is varied
	- varied benefits
- Domain Review
	- Category Learning
		- Posner, Hahn, Nosofsky
	- Visuomotor learning
		- Schmidt, Wrisberg, Newell, Catalano, Chua
		- Kerr & Booth scenario
			- issue of how to compare to Goode study if this is brought up under visuomotor
- Issues
	- distance - assumptions about generalization
	- amount of learning 
	- discrepant results
- Similarity and Instance based models (what is acquired, and how it generalizes)


## Issues with intro structure

When I review the literature - it would be nice to have already introduced the similarity and instance-based concepts - so that I can critique papers using those ideas. 
	- could save the critiqable papers for IGAS specific intro?

Difficult to talk about the "benefits of variability" idea without evoking theoretical lenses - which will be awkward if I want to have a dedicated theoretical accounts section later. 
	- maybe I don't need a dedicated theory section - but can describe relevant theories as they come up in other sections


Domain specific sections vs. Literature pattern sections. 


## What goes where

Catalano & Kleiner study currently in both intro and IGAS discussion. I think it probably works best in IGAS discussion - at least in terms of full form. 


### What might be incorrect
Description of Posner theory as prototypes being retrieved. 
	- should also be clear that Posner didn't formalize prototype model
Use of Palmeri & Nosofsky 2001 against Posner - prototypes being extreme points doesn't have to mean that they're closer to training items - I should either remove this, or evoke it more generally as a critique or issue with Posner's assumptions

distinction between types of category learning variability work. Explanation of Tenenbaum & Griffiths effects

Schema theory description

### What's missing

Proper description of worse at learning, better at testing pattern


Any mention of social variability work
