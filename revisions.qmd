## Primary Issues

1) General Discussion, idea of fitting ALM & EXAM to project 1 - parameter comparison across projects. 
2) Rationale for ordinal feedback in experiment 3. Literature suggesting ordinal is different from continuous. Discussion of how ordinal feedback could be implemented in the model
3) Project 2 discussion - implications of empirical results, and of modeling, take-aways from project
4) More foreshadowing of function learning literature. Show how Projects 1 and 2 are unified in terms of exploring theories of how variability during learning affects generalization.
5) learning c - how how does this show up in training data? Process by which c is updated? Can it account for massed vs. distributed presentation of stimulii?
6) Distinction between experienced stimulii and behavioral action
